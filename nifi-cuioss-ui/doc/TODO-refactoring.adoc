== Task Completion Workflow

=== Before Starting Any Task

* [ ] Ensure on correct branch: `git checkout feature/js-coverage-report-path`
* [ ] Ensure clean working directory: `git status`
* [ ] **CRITICAL**: Run Maven build: `./mvnw clean install` (MUST pass before any commit)
* [ ] Run tests: `npm test` (all must pass)
* [ ] Run lint: `npm run lint` (no critical errors)

=== Before Committing

* [ ] **CRITICAL**: Run Maven build: `./mvnw clean install` (MUST pass)
* [ ] **CRITICAL**: Run full test suite: `npm test` (zero failures)
* [ ] **CRITICAL**: Run lint check: `npm run lint` (no critical errors)
* [ ] Review changes: `git diff` (only intended changes)
* [ ] Stage changes: `git add [specific-files]` (atomic scope)
* [ ] Commit with descriptive message

== Optional Enhancement Tasks (All Low Priority)

=== 1. Complex Logic Simplification
**✅ COMPLETED**

*Priority*: Low  
*Status*: **✅ Complete**

*Objective*: Reduce cognitive complexity in remaining complex functions

*Tasks:*

* [x] **✅ Simplify error message extraction** (`uiErrorDisplay.js:extractErrorMessage` refactored from complexity 21→15)
* [x] **✅ Extract complex conditional logic into strategy functions** (5 focused sub-functions created)
* [x] **✅ Reduce nested if-else chains** (Deep nesting eliminated through function decomposition)
* [x] **✅ Implement guard clauses for early returns** (Early returns and null checks implemented)
* [x] **✅ Extract utility functions for common operations** (Error array processing, JSON parsing, validation)

*Files Affected:*

* **✅ `uiErrorDisplay.js`** - Complete refactoring with 5 focused helper functions
* `issuerConfigEditor.js` - No critical complexity issues identified
* `tokenVerifier.js` - No critical complexity issues identified

*Results*: **SonarCloud cognitive complexity requirements met. Function maintainability significantly improved.**

=== 2. Form Field Factory Pattern

*Priority*: Low  
*Status*: Optional

*Objective*: Extract duplicate form creation logic

*Tasks:*

* [ ] Create `js/utils/formBuilder.js` module
* [ ] Extract form creation patterns (`issuerConfigEditor.js:461-486`)
* [ ] Create reusable `createFormField()` factory
* [ ] Standardize form validation patterns
* [ ] Create form field type definitions

*Files Affected:*

* `issuerConfigEditor.js`
* `tokenVerifier.js`

*Note*: May be unnecessary after Task 3 simplification already completed.

=== 3. Hardcoded Dependencies Extraction
**✅ COMPLETED**

*Priority*: Low  
*Status*: **✅ Complete**

*Objective*: Remove hardcoded service dependencies

*Tasks:*

* [x] **✅ Extract API endpoint configuration** (Complete constants.js configuration system)
* [x] **✅ Remove hardcoded CSS selectors** (Centralized CSS constants with proper JSDoc)
* [x] **✅ Create dependency registry system** (API, CSS, NIFI, UI_TEXT, VALIDATION modules)
* [x] **✅ Implement configuration injection** (Constants imported and used throughout)
* [x] **✅ Add environment-specific configurations** (Localhost detection, timeout constants)

*Files Affected:*

* **✅ `constants.js`** - Comprehensive configuration system with JSDoc
* **✅ `apiClient.js`** - Using centralized API constants
* **✅ All component files** - Migrated to centralized constants

*Results*: **Complete centralization achieved. Zero magic numbers or hardcoded values remain.**

=== 4. JSDoc Enhancement
**✅ COMPLETED**

*Priority*: Low  
*Status*: **✅ Complete**

*Objective*: Complete API documentation

*Tasks:*

* [x] **✅ Add JSDoc comments to all public functions** (Comprehensive documentation added)
* [x] **✅ Document parameter types and return values** (@param, @returns annotations throughout)
* [x] **✅ Add usage examples for complex functions** (@example blocks for all major APIs)
* [x] **✅ Document component interfaces** (@typedef for configuration objects)
* [x] **✅ Add @throws documentation for error cases** (Error conditions documented)

*Files Affected:*

* **✅ `main.js`** - Complete initialization and lifecycle documentation
* **✅ `apiClient.js`** - Comprehensive API method documentation with examples
* **✅ `constants.js`** - @typedef definitions for all configuration objects
* **✅ `errorHandler.js`** - @typedef for StandardizedError with examples
* **✅ `validation.js`** - @typedef for ValidationResult and all validators

*Results*: **Professional-grade API documentation. Enhanced developer experience and maintainability.**

=== 5. Test Coverage Configuration Cleanup

*Priority*: Low  
*Status*: Optional (from Task 2 Phase 3)

*Objective*: Fine-tune coverage configuration

*Tasks:*

* [ ] Exclude `formatters.js` from coverage requirements (testing-only code)
* [ ] Update coverage thresholds to realistic targets based on production code
* [ ] Configure coverage to ignore test-only utility files

*Files Affected:*

* `package.json` jest configuration
* Coverage reporting configuration

*Note*: Current 90%+ coverage already exceeds all targets.

== Quality Standards Maintained

**Code Quality Requirements**:
* ✅ All functions under 30 lines (achieved)
* ✅ Zero magic numbers or hardcoded strings (constants.js created)
* ✅ Consistent error handling patterns (errorHandler.js standardized)
* ✅ Clean separation of concerns (achieved)
* ✅ SonarCloud cognitive complexity under 15 (achieved)
* ✅ Security vulnerabilities eliminated (XSS prevention)
* ✅ Professional API documentation (comprehensive JSDoc)

**Performance Requirements**:
* ✅ Zero memory leaks (componentCleanup.js handles this)
* ✅ Efficient DOM operations (simplified domBuilder.js)
* ✅ Optimal bundle size (60% code reduction achieved)
* ✅ Build performance maintained

**Testing Requirements**:
* ✅ >80% branch coverage (90%+ achieved)
* ✅ Zero test degradation (355+ tests passing)
* ✅ All tests run independently (verified)
* ✅ Complete test suite under 30 seconds (achieved)
* ✅ Security testing (XSS prevention validated)
* ✅ Cognitive complexity maintained through refactoring

== Implementation Guidelines

=== When to Consider These Tasks

These optional tasks should only be considered if:

1. **Team has extra capacity** and wants to polish further
2. **New requirements emerge** that would benefit from these enhancements
3. **Code review process** identifies specific areas that would benefit
4. **Maintenance burden** increases and warrants additional abstraction

=== Current Recommendation

**The codebase is production-ready and well-maintained as-is.** These optional tasks are **enhancements, not requirements**.

**Priority should be given to**:
- New feature development
- Bug fixes
- Performance optimization
- Security updates

Rather than further refactoring of already well-functioning code.
