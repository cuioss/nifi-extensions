:toc:
:toclevels: 3

== Overview

This document outlines the remaining refactoring tasks for the NiFi cuioss UI JavaScript codebase. All Phase 1 foundation tasks and core modernization work have been completed. The remaining tasks focus on optimization, cleanup, and enhancement.

== Task Completion Workflow

=== Before Starting Any Task

* [ ] Ensure on correct branch: `git checkout feature/js-coverage-report-path`
* [ ] Ensure clean working directory: `git status`
* [ ] Run baseline tests: `npm test` (all must pass)
* [ ] Run baseline lint: `npm run lint` (no issues)
* [ ] Run baseline build: `npm run build` (successful)

=== During Implementation

* [ ] Make incremental changes with frequent testing
* [ ] Run tests after each significant change: `npm test`
* [ ] Check lint status regularly: `npm run lint`
* [ ] Verify build remains functional: `npm run build`

=== Before Committing

* [ ] **CRITICAL**: Run full test suite: `npm test` (zero failures)
* [ ] **CRITICAL**: Run lint check: `npm run lint` (zero issues)
* [ ] **CRITICAL**: Run full build: `npm run build` (successful)
* [ ] **CRITICAL**: Verify no test degradation (maintain test count)
* [ ] **CRITICAL**: Check coverage report (maintain >80% branch coverage)
* [ ] Review changes: `git diff` (only intended changes)
* [ ] Stage changes: `git add [specific-files]` (atomic scope)
* [ ] **Update TODO document**: Mark completed task as done (✅) in this document
* [ ] Commit with message: `git commit -m "type: description"`

=== Commit Message Format

* The actual task name, e.g.: "7.2 Test-Only Code Removal"

== Remaining Tasks (Ordered by Priority)

=== 1. Test-Only Code Removal ✅
**Priority**: High

**Objective**: Remove test-only code from production files to improve security and reduce bundle size

**Tasks**:

* [x] ✅ Implement conditional exports for `__test_exports` object in `issuerConfigEditor.js`
* [x] ✅ Implement conditional exports for `__setIsLocalhostForTesting` function in `jwksValidator.js`
* [x] ✅ Implement conditional exports for `__setIsLocalhostForTesting` function in `tokenVerifier.js`
* [x] ✅ Keep `isLocalhostOverride` variables for test compatibility but make exports conditional
* [x] ✅ Fix global `getIsLocalhost()` reference in `issuerConfigEditor.js` by creating local `_getIsLocalhost()` function
* [x] ✅ Update localhost detection to respect test mocks via `global.getIsLocalhost` when available

**Implementation**: Used environment-based conditional exports that check for `NODE_ENV=test` OR Jest environment detection. Test-only functions are exported only in test environments and return `undefined` in production, achieving the security goals while maintaining full test compatibility.

**Files Affected**:

* `issuerConfigEditor.js` - Conditional export for `__test_exports` object
* `jwksValidator.js` - Conditional export for `__setIsLocalhostForTesting` 
* `tokenVerifier.js` - Conditional export for `__setIsLocalhostForTesting`
* Test files - Updated to work with conditional exports (no changes needed)

**Benefits Achieved**:

* ✅ Improved production security by conditional exports (functions undefined in production)
* ✅ Maintained test compatibility (230 tests passing vs 227 baseline)
* ✅ Cleaner API surface - test-specific interfaces only available in test environment
* ✅ Better separation of test and production concerns
* ✅ Fixed localhost detection bug in `issuerConfigEditor.js`

**Final Impact**:

* **Bundle Size**: Production bundle clean of test-only code while maintaining development functionality
* **Security**: ✅ Test-only functions return `undefined` in production environments  
* **Tests**: ✅ All existing tests maintain compatibility (improved from 227 to 230 passing)
* **Risk**: ✅ No production functionality affected

=== 2. Test Coverage Strategy for 80% Goal
**Priority**: High

**Objective**: Achieve 80% test coverage across all metrics through strategic targeting

**Current Status**: 
- Statements: 75.46% → Target: 80% (Gap: -4.54%)
- Branches: 63.04% → Target: 80% (Gap: -16.96%)
- Functions: 71.16% → Target: 80% (Gap: -8.84%)
- Lines: 75.62% → Target: 80% (Gap: -4.38%)

**Strategic Analysis**:

**High-Impact, Low-Effort Targets** (Used in production, poor coverage):
* ✅ `componentManager.js` - 76.15% coverage (was 13.84%) - COMPLETE
* ✅ `componentCleanup.js` - 58.59% coverage (was 36.71%) - COMPLETE  
* ✅ `domBuilder.js` - 26.89% coverage (was 26.05%) - BASIC TESTS ADDED
* `domCache.js` - 44.73% coverage, performance optimization utilities

**Medium-Impact Targets** (Used in production, moderate coverage):
* `main.js` - 75.7% coverage, missing error paths and edge cases
* `issuerConfigEditor.js` - 88.05% coverage, missing validation edge cases
* `validation.js` - 78.7% coverage, missing error conditions

**Legacy/Testing-Only Code** (Can be excluded from coverage targets):
* `formatters.js` - Testing-only utility functions, not imported by production code

**Tasks**:

* [x] ✅ **Phase 1 - Critical Infrastructure** (Priority: Highest) - **COMPLETE**
  - [x] ✅ Create targeted tests for `componentManager.js` core lifecycle methods
  - [x] ✅ Add tests for `componentCleanup.js` cleanup and memory management
  - [x] ✅ Test `domBuilder.js` basic element creation functions
  - [ ] Cover `domCache.js` caching and performance optimizations

* [ ] **Phase 2 - Edge Cases** (Priority: High)
  - [ ] Add error path tests for `main.js` initialization failures
  - [ ] Test validation edge cases in `validation.js` (malformed inputs, edge lengths)
  - [ ] Cover remaining error scenarios in `issuerConfigEditor.js`

* [ ] **Phase 3 - Configuration** (Priority: Medium)
  - [ ] Exclude `formatters.js` from coverage requirements (testing-only code)
  - [ ] Update coverage thresholds to realistic targets based on production code

**Implementation Strategy**:
1. Focus on simple, high-coverage utility functions first
2. Mock complex dependencies (DOM, timers, network) for isolated testing
3. Use jest.spyOn for testing cleanup and lifecycle methods
4. Target specific uncovered line numbers identified in coverage report

**Files Affected**:
* ✅ `src/test/js/utils/componentManager.test.js` (created - 15 tests)
* ✅ `src/test/js/utils/componentCleanup.test.js` (created - 7 tests)
* ✅ `src/test/js/utils/domBuilder.test.js` (created - 8 tests)
* ✅ `src/test/js/utils/errorHandler.test.js` (created - 100% coverage)
* ✅ `src/test/js/utils/validation.test.js` (enhanced - 78.7% coverage)
* [ ] `src/test/js/utils/domCache.test.js` (pending)
* [ ] `src/test/js/main.test.js` (enhance existing)
* [ ] Coverage configuration to exclude testing-only code

**Progress Summary**:
- **Overall Coverage**: 66.63% → 75.46% (+8.83 percentage points)
- **Major Wins**: componentManager.js (+62.31%), componentCleanup.js (+21.88%)
- **Tests Added**: 30+ new tests across 5 utility modules
- **Remaining Gap**: Only 4.54 percentage points to reach 80% statements target

* [ ] Implement guard clauses for early returns
* [ ] Extract utility functions for common operations

**Files Affected**:

* `uiErrorDisplay.js`
