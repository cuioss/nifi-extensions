:toclevels: 2

== Overview

This document outlines the remaining optional tasks for the NiFi CUIOSS UI JavaScript codebase.

NOTE: This library implements a minimal three-tab UI and does not require enterprise-grade structures or excessive polish. The current implementation is already functional and suitable for its purpose.

== Development Workflow

=== Before Starting Any Task

* Ensure on correct branch: `git checkout feature/js-coverage-report-path` (in root directory)
* Ensure clean working directory: `git status` (in root directory)
* Run Maven build: `./mvnw clean install` (MUST pass) (in root directory)
* Run tests: `npm test` (all must pass) (in nifi-cuioss-ui directory)
* Run lint: `npm run lint` (no critical errors) (in nifi-cuioss-ui directory)

=== Before Committing

* Run full test suite: `npm test` (zero failures) (in nifi-cuioss-ui directory)
* Run lint check: `npm run lint` (no critical errors) (in nifi-cuioss-ui directory)
* Run Maven build: `./mvnw clean install` (MUST pass) (in root directory)
* Ensure no test degradation:
  ** No drop in test coverage
  ** No skipped, disabled, or un-commented tests
  ** No reduction in assertion count
* Review changes: `git diff` (only intended changes) (in root directory)
* Stage changes: `git add [specific-files]` (atomic scope) (in root directory)
* Mark tasks as complete in this document
* Commit with descriptive message (in root directory)

=== Directory Structure

* Root directory: `/Users/oliver/git/nifi-extensions`
* UI module directory: `/Users/oliver/git/nifi-extensions/nifi-cuioss-ui`
