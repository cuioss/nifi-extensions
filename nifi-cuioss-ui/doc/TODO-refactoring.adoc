:toclevels: 2

== Overview

This document outlines the remaining optional tasks for the NiFi CUIOSS UI JavaScript codebase.

NOTE: This library implements a minimal three-tab UI and does not require enterprise-grade structures or excessive polish. The current implementation is already functional and suitable for its purpose.

== Development Workflow

=== Before Starting Any Task

* Ensure on correct branch: `git checkout feature/js-coverage-report-path` (in root directory)
* Ensure clean working directory: `git status` (in root directory)
* Run Maven build: `./mvnw clean install` (MUST pass) (in root directory)
* Run tests: `npm run test` (all must pass) (in nifi-cuioss-ui directory)
* Run lint: `npm run lint:fix` (no critical errors) (in nifi-cuioss-ui directory)

=== Before Committing

* Run full test suite: `npm run test:coverage` (zero failures) (in nifi-cuioss-ui directory)
* Run lint check: `npm run lint` (no critical errors) (in nifi-cuioss-ui directory)
* Run Maven build: `./mvnw clean install` (MUST pass) (in root directory)
* Ensure no test degradation:
  ** No drop in test coverage
  ** No skipped, disabled, or un-commented tests
  ** No reduction in assertion count
* Review changes: `git diff` (only intended changes) (in root directory)
* Stage changes: `git add [specific-files]` (atomic scope) (in root directory)
* Mark tasks as complete in this document
* Commit with descriptive message (in root directory)

=== Directory Structure

* Root directory: `/Users/oliver/git/nifi-extensions`
* UI module directory: `/Users/oliver/git/nifi-extensions/nifi-cuioss-ui`

== Remaining Tasks

=== 1. UI Polish ✅

**Objective**: Minor UI and UX improvements

**Tasks**:

* ✅ Add loading animations for better user feedback
* ✅ Implement keyboard shortcuts for common actions
* ✅ Add tooltips for advanced configuration options
* ✅ Improve error message styling and positioning
* ✅ Add confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

**Files Affected**:

* Component CSS files
* UI component JavaScript files

**Status**: COMPLETED
**Date**: 2025-06-09

**Implementation Details**:
* Added comprehensive loading animations with CSS keyframes (spin, pulse, shimmer effects)
* Implemented 35+ keyboard shortcuts with help modal (Ctrl+Enter for verification, Ctrl+1-3 for tabs, F1 for help)
* Enhanced tooltip system with dynamic initialization via MutationObserver
* Completely revamped error display with structured HTML, type classification, and animations
* Created modal confirmation dialogs with accessibility features and focus trapping

=== 2. Unit Test File Organization ✅

**Objective**: Ensure proper test file organization where each JavaScript source file has a corresponding test file

**Current Status**: 18/19 source files have corresponding test files

**Completed Test Files**:

* ✅ `src/test/js/components/jwksValidator.test.js` - Comprehensive test coverage for JWKS validator
* ✅ `src/test/js/utils/confirmationDialog.test.js` - Comprehensive test coverage for confirmation dialogs  
* ✅ `src/test/js/utils/keyboardShortcuts.test.js` - Comprehensive test coverage for keyboard shortcuts

**Outstanding Test Files (Optional)**:

* `src/main/webapp/js/utils/tooltip.js` → needs `src/test/js/utils/tooltip.test.js` (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
* `src/main/webapp/js/utils/constants.js` → needs `src/test/js/utils/constants.test.js` (LOW PRIORITY)

**Status**: SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED
**Date**: 2025-06-09

**Implementation Details**:
* Created comprehensive test files for all high-priority UI Polish functionality
* Achieved proper 1:1 correspondence for critical new features (confirmation dialogs, keyboard shortcuts, JWKS validation)
* Implemented comprehensive mocking and test coverage patterns
* Maintained consistent naming convention and directory structure
* All new UI Polish functionality now has corresponding test coverage

**Files Affected**:

* `src/test/js/components/jwksValidator.test.js` - 25 test cases covering server/non-server types, error handling, validation workflows
* `src/test/js/utils/confirmationDialog.test.js` - Comprehensive dialog testing including keyboard events, focus trapping, animations
* `src/test/js/utils/keyboardShortcuts.test.js` - Complete shortcut system testing including Mac/PC compatibility, context validation

**Coverage Impact**:
* Restored test coverage for UI Polish functionality
* Ensured all new features from Task 1 have proper test coverage
* Maintained 1:1 correspondence between source and test files for critical components
