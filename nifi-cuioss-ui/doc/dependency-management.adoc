= JavaScript Dependency Management
:toc:
:toclevels: 3

== Overview

This document describes the JavaScript dependency management approach used in the nifi-cuioss-ui module.

== Dependency Management Strategy

=== Maven-first Approach with npm for Development Tools

The nifi-cuioss-ui module uses a Maven-first approach for JavaScript dependency management:

* *WebJars* are the primary source for runtime dependencies
* *npm* is used exclusively for development tools and build processes

This approach:

* Simplifies runtime dependency management
* Ensures consistency in deployed artifacts
* Maintains Java/Maven ecosystem compatibility
* Leverages npm for developer experience and build tools

=== Dependency Types

==== Runtime Dependencies

Runtime dependencies are JavaScript libraries required by the application at runtime:

* Managed through WebJars in `pom.xml`
* Versions defined as Maven properties with `version.webjars.*` prefix
* Included in the WAR file through Maven overlays
* Referenced in HTML through WebJars paths
* Declared as externals in webpack configuration

Current runtime dependencies:

* cash-dom (jQuery alternative)
* tippy.js (tooltips)
* @popperjs/core (required by tippy.js)
* font-awesome (icons)
* requirejs (module loading)

==== Development Dependencies

Development dependencies are tools used during development and build:

* Managed through npm in `package.json`
* Listed in the `devDependencies` section
* Not included in the production build

Current development tool categories:

* Build tools (webpack, babel)
* Testing tools (jest)
* Code quality tools (eslint, stylelint)
* Development versions of runtime dependencies (for IDE support)

=== Version Alignment

To ensure consistency, runtime dependency versions must be aligned between:

* WebJars versions in `pom.xml`
* Development versions in `package.json`

A validation script (`scripts/validate-dependencies.js`) checks this alignment and is integrated into the Maven build process during the verify phase.

== Implementation Details

=== Maven Configuration

WebJars dependencies are declared in `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<properties>
    <!-- WebJars versions -->
    <version.webjars.cash-dom>8.1.5</version.webjars.cash-dom>
    <version.webjars.tippy.js>6.3.7</version.webjars.tippy.js>
    <version.webjars.popperjs__core>2.11.8</version.webjars.popperjs__core>
</properties>

<dependencies>
    <!-- Runtime JavaScript dependencies as WebJars -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.webjars.npm</groupId>
        <artifactId>cash-dom</artifactId>
        <version>${version.webjars.cash-dom}</version>
    </dependency>
    <!-- Other WebJars dependencies -->
</dependencies>
----

=== npm Configuration

The `package.json` file clearly separates development and runtime dependencies:

[source,json]
----
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "_comment": "Development tools and runtime dependencies for development",
    "webpack": "^5.92.1",
    "eslint": "^8.57.0",
    "jest": "^29.7.0",
    "cash-dom": "8.1.5"
  },
  "dependencies": {
  }
}
----

NOTE: The `dependencies` section is intentionally empty because all runtime dependencies are managed via WebJars in the Maven build.

=== Webpack Configuration

The webpack configuration handles WebJars dependencies:

[source,javascript]
----
module.exports = {
  // ...
  externals: {
    // Prevent bundling of certain imported packages and instead retrieve these
    // external dependencies at runtime (from WebJars)
    'cash-dom': 'cash',
    'tippy.js': 'tippy',
    '@popperjs/core': 'Popper'
  }
}
----

=== HTML Configuration

Runtime dependencies are loaded from WebJars in HTML:

[source,html]
----
<!-- Load Cash-DOM (jQuery alternative) -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="webjars/META-INF/resources/webjars/cash-dom/8.1.5/dist/cash.min.js"></script>

<!-- Load Popper.js (required by Tippy.js) -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="webjars/META-INF/resources/webjars/popperjs__core/2.11.8/dist/umd/popper.min.js"></script>

<!-- Load Tippy.js -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="webjars/META-INF/resources/webjars/tippy.js/6.3.7/dist/tippy.umd.min.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="webjars/META-INF/resources/webjars/tippy.js/6.3.7/dist/tippy.css">
----

== Development Workflow

=== Adding a New Dependency

To add a new runtime dependency:

1. Add the WebJar dependency to `pom.xml` with a version property
2. Add the dependency to the overlays section in `pom.xml`
3. Add the dependency to `package.json` in `devDependencies` with the same version
4. Add the dependency to the externals section in `webpack.config.js`
5. Add the script/link tag to `index.html` to load from WebJars
6. Update the dependency mapping in `scripts/validate-dependencies.js`

=== Updating a Dependency Version

To update a dependency version:

1. Update the version property in `pom.xml`
2. Update the version in `package.json`
3. Update any version references in `index.html`
4. Run `npm run validate-deps` to verify alignment

== Validation

The dependency validation script checks for version alignment between npm and WebJars:

[source,bash]
----
# Run validation manually
npm run validate-deps

# Validation is also run during Maven build
./mvnw clean install
----
