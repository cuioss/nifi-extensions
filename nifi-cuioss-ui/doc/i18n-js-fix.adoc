= i18n.js MIME Type Fix

This document describes the changes made to fix the MIME type mismatch issue with the i18n.js file.

== Issue Description

The resource from "https://localhost:9095/nifi-cuioss-ui-1.0-SNAPSHOT/utils/i18n.js" was blocked due to MIME type ("text/html") mismatch (X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff).

The issue was that the browser was trying to load the i18n.js file from a different path than what was configured in RequireJS. The browser was looking for the file at "utils/i18n.js", but the file was actually located at "js/utils/i18n.js".

== Changes Made

1. Added a path mapping for 'utils/i18n' in the RequireJS configuration in index.html:
+
[source,javascript]
----
require.config({
    paths: {
        // ... other paths
        'utils/i18n': ['js/utils/i18n']
    }
});
----

2. Created a copy of the i18n.js file in the utils directory:
+
[source,bash]
----
mkdir -p nifi-cuioss-ui/src/main/webapp/utils
cp nifi-cuioss-ui/src/main/webapp/js/utils/i18n.js nifi-cuioss-ui/src/main/webapp/utils/
----

== Result

These changes ensure that:

1. The i18n.js file is properly loaded from the correct path
2. The browser can find the i18n.js file at the path it's looking for
3. The MIME type mismatch issue is resolved

After these changes, the browser should no longer block the i18n.js file due to MIME type mismatch.
