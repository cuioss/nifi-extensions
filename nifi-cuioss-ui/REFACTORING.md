# Refactoring Changes

This document describes the refactoring changes made to the nifi-cuioss-ui module to improve code quality, maintainability, and performance.

## CSS Refactoring

### Eliminated Redundant CSS File
- Removed `main.css` which only imported `styles.css`
- Updated all references to use `styles.css` directly
- This reduces HTTP requests and simplifies the CSS structure

### Reorganized CSS Structure
- Moved base styles to the top of `styles.css`
- Added CSS custom properties (variables) for colors
- Updated styles to use the color variables
- Removed duplicate style definitions
- This improves maintainability and consistency

## JavaScript Refactoring

### Consolidated Initialization Flow
- Removed inline `nf.Common` mock from `index.html`
- Simplified `nf-jwt-validator.js` to delegate to `main.js`
- Simplified `bundle.js` to avoid duplication
- This reduces code duplication and potential inconsistencies

### Reduced Debug Logging
- Removed excessive debug logging throughout the codebase
- Kept essential error logging
- This improves performance and readability

### Fixed i18n.js MIME Type Issue
- Added path mapping for 'utils/i18n' in RequireJS configuration
- Created a copy of i18n.js in the utils directory
- This resolves the MIME type mismatch error when loading i18n.js

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Improved Maintainability**: The code is now more organized and follows better practices.
2. **Reduced Duplication**: Eliminated redundant code and files.
3. **Better Performance**: Fewer HTTP requests and less console logging.
4. **Consistent Styling**: Using CSS variables ensures consistent colors throughout the UI.
5. **Simplified Architecture**: Clearer initialization flow and component structure.
6. **Enhanced Localization**: Improved language support with a more robust i18n module.
7. **Fixed Resource Loading**: Resolved MIME type mismatch issues with proper path configuration.

## Future Improvements

1. **Modularize CSS**: Further split `styles.css` into component-specific files. âœ“
2. **Add Unit Tests**: Create automated tests for the UI components.
3. **Enhance Localization**: Add more languages and improve translation coverage.
