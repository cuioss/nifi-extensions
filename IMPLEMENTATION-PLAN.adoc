== Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for completing the NiFi JWT Authenticator.

Last updated: 2025-01-27 (Branch: feature/p1-core-functionality)

=== Current Status

* ✅ *Phase 0*: Test Infrastructure - COMPLETED
* ✅ *Phase 1*: Core Functionality - COMPLETED (except YAML support - removed from scope)
* 🚧 *Phase 2*: UI Enhancement - IN PROGRESS
  ** ✅ E2E test infrastructure complete
  ** ✅ REST API endpoints implemented (backend only)
  ** ❌ UI components not connected to REST endpoints
  ** ❌ E2E tests failing due to missing UI integration
* ❌ *Phase 3*: Observability - NOT STARTED
* ❌ *Phase 4*: Advanced Features - NOT STARTED
* ❌ *Phase 5*: Documentation & Polish - NOT STARTED

=== Completed Tasks

* Test infrastructure fixed (DynamicPropertyTestHelper)
* Authorization implementation (scope/role validation)
* Flow file attributes (jwt.scopes, jwt.roles, jwt.authorized)
* All 62 processor tests passing
* E2E test infrastructure improved (test error handler utility)
* Created E2E tests for all Phase 2 UI features (7 test files)
* Fixed ESLint warnings (reduced from 68 to 13, below 25 limit)
* Modernized E2E test structure with 2025 best practices
* Implemented service-oriented test architecture (AuthService, ConsoleLogger, CriticalErrorDetector)
* *NEW (2025-01-27)*: Implemented JWT REST API endpoints (backend only):
  ** Created shared IssuerConfigurationParser
  ** Implemented JwtVerificationServlet, JwksValidationServlet, MetricsServlet
  ** Added ApiKeyAuthenticationFilter for security
  ** Created supporting services (JwtValidationService, ProcessorConfigReader)
  ** All backend tests passing

== Remaining Tasks

=== Phase 2: UI Enhancement (P2)

NOTE: Each UI feature requires a corresponding E2E test in `e-2-e-playwright/tests/`. See `e-2-e-playwright/docs/roundtrip-testing.adoc` for implementation guide.

*UPDATE 2025-07-26*: E2E test files have been created for all Phase 2 UI features. These tests are currently failing as expected since the UI components haven't been implemented yet. The tests will serve as acceptance criteria for the UI implementation.

IMPORTANT: UI E2E tests (02-06, 08 files) are currently failing because they attempt to access the custom UI directly at `/nifi-cuioss-ui-1.0-SNAPSHOT/`. These tests need to be updated to:
1. Navigate to NiFi canvas
2. Create/configure a MultiIssuerJWTTokenAuthenticator processor
3. Open the processor's configuration dialog
4. Access the custom UI within the processor context

Until this navigation pattern is fixed, these tests will continue to fail with "EMPTY_PAGE - Canvas element not found" errors.

*UPDATE 2025-01-27*: The root cause is now understood - the UI components exist but are not integrated with the REST endpoints. The backend REST API is complete but the frontend JavaScript code doesn't call these endpoints yet.

==== Current Branch Status (refactor/e2e-test-structure-makeover)

This branch has completed the E2E test infrastructure refactoring:

* ✅ All 7 E2E test files created for Phase 2 UI features
* ✅ Test infrastructure modernized with service-oriented architecture
* ✅ Error handling utilities implemented (test-error-handler.js)
* ✅ Authentication service abstraction (auth-service.js)
* ✅ Console logging infrastructure (console-logger.js)
* ✅ Critical error detection (critical-error-detector.js)

==== Next Steps for UI Implementation (Updated 2025-01-27)

1. **Frontend Integration Prerequisites**:
   - [ ] Generate API keys in processor and pass to UI
   - [ ] Implement `MultiIssuerJwtAuthenticatorCustomizer.js` as the main custom UI component
   - [ ] Set up tab-based navigation structure

2. **Connect UI Components to REST Endpoints**:
   - [ ] Update JavaScript to call REST endpoints with authentication
   - [ ] Token Verification Tab - connect to `/nifi-api/processors/jwt/verify-token`
   - [ ] JWKS Validation Button - connect to `/nifi-api/processors/jwt/validate-jwks`
   - [ ] Metrics Tab - connect to `/nifi-api/processors/jwt/metrics`
   - [ ] Ensure UI tabs display data from API responses

3. **Complete JWKS Validation Features**:
   - [ ] Add URL validation for JWKS endpoints (frontend)
   - [ ] Add file existence validation (frontend)
   - [ ] Implement validation button backend logic

4. **Testing**:
   - [ ] Run E2E tests to verify integration
   - [ ] Each implemented feature should pass its corresponding E2E test
   - [ ] Use failing tests as implementation guide

NOTE: The backend REST endpoints are fully implemented. The focus now is on frontend integration.

==== 2.1 Custom UI Components
* [x] Create custom UI structure (implemented as complete web app in nifi-cuioss-ui module)
* [x] Create E2E test: `02-verify-jwt-authenticator-customizer.spec.js`
* [ ] Implement JWKS Validation Button
* [x] Create E2E test: `03-verify-jwks-validation-button.spec.js`
* [x] Add Token Verification Tab (component exists, needs full implementation)
* [x] Create E2E test: `04-verify-token-verification-tab.spec.js`
* [x] Add Metrics Tab
* [x] Create E2E test: `05-verify-metrics-tab.spec.js`
* [x] Add Help Tab
* [x] Create E2E test: `06-verify-help-tab.spec.js`

==== 2.2 REST Endpoint
* [x] Research NiFi REST endpoint patterns
* [x] Document implementation approach for production
* [x] Update E2E tests to skip when endpoints unavailable
* [x] Create E2E test: `07-verify-token-verification-api.spec.js` (CURRENTLY SKIPPED - requires implementation)
* [x] *COMPLETED (2025-01-27)*: Backend implementation using servlets (see doc/jwt-api-endpoints-implementation.md)
  ** [x] JwtVerificationServlet at `/nifi-api/processors/jwt/verify-token`
  ** [x] JwksValidationServlet at `/nifi-api/processors/jwt/validate-jwks`
  ** [x] MetricsServlet at `/nifi-api/processors/jwt/metrics`
  ** [x] ApiKeyAuthenticationFilter for security
* [ ] Frontend integration - connect UI components to REST endpoints
* [ ] Generate API keys in processor and pass to UI
* [ ] Update JavaScript to call REST endpoints with authentication

NOTE: Backend REST endpoints are implemented but not integrated with the UI. The E2E tests fail because they expect UI components to be connected to these endpoints.

==== 2.3 JWKS Validation
* [x] *PARTIAL (2025-01-27)*: Backend servlet implemented (`JwksValidationServlet`)
* [ ] Add URL validation for JWKS endpoints (frontend validation)
* [ ] Add file existence validation (frontend validation)
* [ ] Connect validation button to backend endpoint
* [x] Create E2E test: `08-verify-jwks-validation-complete.spec.js`

==== 2.4 Test Infrastructure (COMPLETED in this branch)
* [x] Modernize E2E test structure
* [x] Implement test error handler utility
* [x] Create authentication service abstraction
* [x] Add console logging infrastructure
* [x] Implement critical error detection
* [x] Create all Phase 2 E2E test files

   - Implemented service-oriented architecture for better maintainability
   - Added comprehensive error handling and logging capabilities

2. **Test Coverage for Phase 2**:
   - Created 7 new E2E test files covering all planned UI features
   - Tests serve as acceptance criteria for UI implementation
   - Tests are currently failing (expected) awaiting UI implementation

3. **Utility Services Created**:
   - `test-error-handler.js` - Centralized error handling with log preservation
   - `auth-service.js` - Authentication abstraction for tests
   - `console-logger.js` - Browser console log capture

=== Ready for Next Phase

With this branch complete, the project is now ready for:
1. UI component implementation (MultiIssuerJwtAuthenticatorCustomizer.js)
2. Backend REST endpoint creation
3. Feature-by-feature implementation guided by failing E2E tests

The failing E2E tests provide a clear roadmap for implementing each UI feature, ensuring that acceptance criteria are met as development progresses.
