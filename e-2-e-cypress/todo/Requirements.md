## üîÑ Test Execution Principles

### 1. **Complete Workflow Testing**
Tests must validate entire user workflows, not just individual component functionality. Shallow tests that only check element presence can provide false confidence.

### 2. **Real-World Scenarios**
Tests should mirror actual user behavior and real-world usage patterns, including error conditions and edge cases.

### 3. **Integration Over Isolation**
While unit tests focus on isolation, these E2E tests must validate integration between components and systems.

### 4. **Failure Detection**
Tests must be capable of detecting both obvious failures and subtle degradation in system behavior.

### 5. **Maintainability**
Test requirements should be stable even as implementation details change, focusing on user-visible behavior rather than internal mechanics.

## üìä Success Metrics

### Overall System Health:
- **Test Pass Rate**: ‚â•95% of tests should pass consistently
- **Coverage**: All critical user workflows covered by automated tests
- **Reliability**: Tests should be stable and not prone to false failures
- **Execution Time**: Full test suite completes within reasonable time limits

### Quality Gates:
- No console errors during normal operation
- All processor types available and functional
- Complete user workflows execute successfully
- System performs adequately under expected load
- Error conditions are handled gracefully

This requirements document serves as the foundation for implementing comprehensive E2E tests that validate the complete JWT authentication extension functionality within the NiFi environment.
