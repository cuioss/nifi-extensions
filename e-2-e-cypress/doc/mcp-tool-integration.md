```

#### 2. Local HTTPS Application Access - Configuration Required
For the NiFi extensions project, we discovered:

**Current Status**:
- ‚úÖ **External websites**: Full functionality verified
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Local HTTPS apps**: Requires SSL certificate configuration
- ‚úÖ **NiFi accessibility**: Confirmed via `curl -k https://localhost:9095/nifi/`

**Certificate Challenge**:
The NiFi test environment uses self-signed certificates. The MCP Playwright tool needs configuration to:
- Accept self-signed certificates
- Bypass SSL verification for localhost
- Use the correct certificate files from `/integration-testing/src/main/docker/certificates/`

### Recommended Solutions

#### Option 1: Configure Playwright to Accept Self-Signed Certificates
```javascript
// This would require configuring the MCP Playwright tool with:
{
  ignoreHTTPSErrors: true,
  acceptDownloads: true,
  bypassCSP: true
}
```

#### Option 2: Use HTTP for Local Development
```bash
# Modify docker-compose.yml to expose HTTP port
# Add HTTP port mapping for local testing
ports:
  - "9094:9094"  # HTTP port
  - "9095:9095"  # HTTPS port
```

#### Option 3: Install Certificates in Playwright Container
```bash
# Mount certificate directory to Playwright container
# Configure container to trust local certificates
```

This approach modifies the MCP Playwright tool configuration to accept self-signed certificates:

```bash
# Enhanced Docker configuration for local development
docker run -i --rm \
  --add-host=localhost:127.0.0.1 \
  -e PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=0 \
  -e PLAYWRIGHT_IGNORE_HTTPS_ERRORS=true \
  mcp/playwright
```

**Pros**: 
- Maintains existing HTTPS security model
- Works with current NiFi Docker setup
- No changes to application configuration

**Cons**: 
- Requires MCP Playwright tool enhancement
- May need custom Docker image

### Approach 2: Dual HTTP/HTTPS Configuration
Modify the NiFi Docker setup to expose both HTTP and HTTPS ports:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml addition
services:
  nifi:
    ports:
      - "9094:9094"  # HTTP port for MCP Playwright
      - "9095:9095"  # HTTPS port for production use
    environment:
      - NIFI_WEB_HTTP_PORT=9094
      - NIFI_WEB_HTTPS_PORT=9095
```

**Pros**: 
- Simple implementation
- No certificate issues
- Works immediately with MCP Playwright

**Cons**:

### Approach 3: Certificate Installation in Container
Mount the local certificates in the MCP Playwright container:

```bash
# Mount certificates to Playwright container
docker run -i --rm \
  -v /Users/oliver/git/nifi-extensions/integration-testing/src/main/docker/certificates:/etc/ssl/certs/local \
  mcp/playwright
```

**Pros**: 
- Most secure approach
- Maintains HTTPS throughout
- Realistic production testing
