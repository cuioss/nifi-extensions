## 📝 Documentation Policy

**IMPORTANT**: Do not create new documentation files. Use existing documentation structure instead.

### Existing Documentation Structure (USE THESE ONLY):
- **[README.md](../README.md)**: Project overview and quick start
- **[doc/overview.md](overview.md)**: Core philosophy and architecture
- **[doc/current-status.md](current-status.md)**: Current implementation status
- **[doc/implementation-guide.md](implementation-guide.md)**: Complete setup and technical details
- **[doc/recipes-and-howto.md](recipes-and-howto.md)**: Practical examples and patterns
- **[doc/tasks-and-next-steps.md](tasks-and-next-steps.md)**: This file - roadmap and task tracking
- **[doc/findings-and-analysis.md](findings-and-analysis.md)**: Technical analysis and discoveries

### Documentation Best Practices:
1. **Update existing files** instead of creating new ones
2. **Integrate new content** into the appropriate existing document
3. **Use sections and subsections** to organize content within existing files
4. **Cross-reference** between existing documents using relative links
5. **Keep documentation structure flat** - avoid deep hierarchies

**Rationale**: Proliferating documentation files makes maintenance difficult and creates information silos. The current 7-file structure covers all necessary aspects comprehensively.

## Architecture Overview
- **Infrastructure**: Docker-based with NiFi 2.4.0 + Keycloak
- **Framework**: Cypress with 15+ custom commands
- **NAR Deployment**: Automatic via Maven (20MB NAR size)
- **Authentication**: Keycloak OIDC (admin/ctsBtRBKHRAx69EqUghvvgEvjnaLjFEB)
- **Test Philosophy**: Testing custom processor logic using NiFi as a platform
- **Analysis Tool**: MCP Playwright integration for UI analysis and exploration (see [MCP Playwright Guide](mcp-playwright-guide.md))

### MCP Playwright Integration for Analysis

For advanced UI analysis and exploration of the NiFi interface, this environment supports MCP Playwright integration:

**🔍 Analysis Capabilities**:
- UI discovery and element identification for testing
- Processor catalog analysis and documentation extraction  
- Test case generation from UI analysis patterns
- Performance monitoring and responsiveness analysis
- Reliable selector identification for dynamic elements

**⚡ Key Benefits**:
- Direct HTTP access (no SSL complexity)
- Anonymous access mode (no authentication overhead)
- Fast analysis (~3 seconds vs 7-8 seconds for auth)
- Consistent UI state for reliable analysis

**📖 Usage**: See [MCP Playwright Guide](mcp-playwright-guide.md) for detailed patterns and workflows.

## Test Environment Architecture

### Docker Infrastructure

The end-to-end testing environment uses a containerized architecture for consistent, reproducible testing:
