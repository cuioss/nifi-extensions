== Purpose

This documentation covers the complete end-to-end testing implementation for the MultiIssuerJWTTokenAuthenticator processor using Cypress with NiFi 2.4.0.

== Testing Philosophy

*We use NiFi as a platform to test our custom processor logic. We don't test NiFi itself.*

=== Testing Focus

* Test JWT validation logic in custom processors
* Test multi-issuer configuration handling
* Test error handling and edge cases

We avoid testing:

* NiFi's authentication system
* NiFi's navigation mechanics
* NiFi's processor framework

== Production Status

The testing framework is fully operational with complete Docker environment and comprehensive testing capabilities.

== Critical Verification Requirements

Before committing any changes, both Maven commands MUST pass:

[source,bash]
----
# 1. Full build verification (required)
./mvnw clean verify

# 2. Integration tests (required)
./mvnw clean verify -pl e-2-e-cypress -Pintegration-tests
----

IMPORTANT: All code changes must be verified with both commands to ensure full build integrity, end-to-end integration functionality, and no regressions in the complete pipeline.

=== CI/CD and Integration

* xref:ci-cd-integration.adoc[CI/CD Integration] - Continuous integration setup and automated testing workflows
* xref:mcp-playwright-guide.adoc[MCP Playwright Integration] - MCP Playwright tool setup for enhanced development workflows

== Quick Start

*Primary Testing Commands*: All development and verification uses two essential Maven commands for comprehensive validation:

[source,bash]
----
# 1. Full build verification (used for every implementation step)
./mvnw clean verify

# 2. Integration tests with Docker environment
./mvnw clean verify -pl e-2-e-cypress -Pintegration-tests
----

*Development Workflow*:

1. Make changes to tests/commands
2. Verify with both Maven commands above
3. Fix any failures immediately (fail-fast principle)
4. Commit only after both commands pass successfully

The Maven command automatically handles:

* Docker container startup (NiFi + Keycloak)
* Dependency installation
* Test execution
* Container cleanup
* Build verification

== Implementation Summary

The testing framework provides comprehensive end-to-end testing capabilities:

* Production-ready framework with comprehensive helper-based architecture
* Helper-based architecture: auth-helper, navigation-helper, processor-helper with cross-integration
* Zero-warning ESLint implementation: Clean, maintainable codebase
* Full Maven integration: Automated Docker lifecycle and test execution
* Comprehensive test coverage: Self-tests, functional tests, and advanced processor testing

== Current Test Suite

*Test Coverage*:

* `01-nifi-authentication.cy.js`: Authentication system testing using auth-helper
* `02-nifi-navigation.cy.js`: Navigation functionality testing using navigation-helper
* `03-processor-add-remove.cy.js`: Processor lifecycle testing using processor-helper

*Test Categories*:

* Authentication Testing (login, logout, session management using auth-helper)
* Navigation Testing (page transitions, canvas access using navigation-helper)
* Processor Testing (add/remove lifecycle using processor-helper)
* Helper Integration (cross-helper usage and authentication-aware operations)
* Session Management (without cy.session for improved reliability)

== Standards and References

This project implements centralized coding standards:

* *JavaScript Standards*: JavaScript and ESLint configuration
* *Testing Standards*: Testing best practices and quality standards
* *Documentation Standards*: Documentation structure and maintenance

== Support

=== For New Team Members

1. Start with xref:overview.adoc[Project Overview]
2. Review xref:setup-guide.adoc[Setup Guide]
3. Review xref:testing-patterns.adoc[Testing Patterns] for practical examples
4. Reference xref:architecture.adoc[Technical Architecture] for technical details

=== For Troubleshooting

1. Check xref:testing-patterns.adoc[Testing Patterns] troubleshooting section
2. Review xref:setup-guide.adoc[Setup Guide] for configuration issues
3. Reference xref:javascript-testing.adoc[JavaScript Testing] for component-specific problems

== Contributing

When adding new functionality:

1. Make incremental changes to tests or commands
2. Always verify each change with both Maven commands
3. Fix any failures immediately before proceeding
4. Commit only after both Maven commands pass successfully
5. Follow patterns in xref:testing-patterns.adoc[Testing Patterns]
6. Use existing custom commands from `/cypress/support/commands/`
7. Focus on testing custom processor logic, not NiFi mechanics
8. Ensure zero ESLint warnings following centralized standards

IMPORTANT: Never modify or add parameters to either Maven verification command. All changes must work with both exact commands as specified.
