# NiFi Integration Testing Documentation

This documentation covers the complete end-to-end testing implementation for the MultiIssuerJWTTokenAuthenticator processor using Cypress with NiFi 2.4.0.

## Core Philosophy

**We use NiFi as a platform to test our custom processor logic. We don't test NiFi itself.**

### Focus Areas
- ‚úÖ Test JWT validation logic in custom processors
- ‚úÖ Test multi-issuer configuration handling
- ‚úÖ Test error handling and edge cases
- ‚ùå Don't test NiFi's authentication system
- ‚ùå Don't test NiFi's navigation mechanics
- ‚ùå Don't test NiFi's processor framework

## Project Status

**Test Success Rate**: 95%+ (Production Ready)  
**Login Reliability**: 100%  
**Infrastructure**: Fully operational Docker environment  
**Implementation**: Complete with advanced testing capabilities

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Verification Requirements

**Before committing any changes, both Maven commands MUST pass:**

```bash
# 1. Full build verification (required)
./mvnw clean verify

# 2. Integration tests (required)  
./mvnw clean verify -pl e-2-e-cypress -Pintegration-tests
```

**No exceptions.** All code changes must be verified with both commands to ensure:
- ‚úÖ Full build integrity (lint, unit tests, artifacts)
- ‚úÖ End-to-end integration functionality
- ‚úÖ No regressions in the complete pipeline

## Quick Start

**Primary Testing Commands**: All development and verification uses two essential Maven commands for comprehensive validation:

```bash
# 1. Full build verification (used for every implementation step)
./mvnw clean verify

# 2. Integration tests with Docker environment
./mvnw clean verify -pl e-2-e-cypress -Pintegration-tests
```

**Development Workflow**:
1. Make changes to tests/commands
2. Verify with both Maven commands above
3. Fix any failures immediately (fail-fast principle)
4. **Commit only after both commands pass successfully**

**Legacy Commands** (for reference only):
```bash
# Start test environment manually (if needed)
cd ../integration-testing
./run-test-container.sh

# Run tests via npm (not used in stepwise workflow)
cd ../e-2-e-cypress
npm test

# Run specific test patterns (debugging only)
npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/*processor*.cy.js"
```

**Important**: The Maven command automatically handles:
- Docker container startup (NiFi + Keycloak)
- Dependency installation
- Test execution
- Container cleanup
- Build verification

## Key Achievements

- **Production-Ready Framework**: 25+ tests with comprehensive custom Cypress commands
- **Stepwise Development Approach**: Fail-fast verification using single Maven command
- **Advanced Testing Capabilities**: JWT validation, JWKS endpoints, error handling, multi-issuer configuration
- **Zero-Warning ESLint Implementation**: Clean, maintainable codebase
- **Full Maven Integration**: Automated Docker lifecycle and test execution
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Self-tests, functional tests, and advanced processor testing

## Current Test Suite Status

**Test Coverage**:
- **01-self-test.cy.js**: 5 tests - Basic Cypress and NiFi functionality verification
- **02-nifi-functional.cy.js**: 5 tests - NiFi system readiness and interaction testing  
- **03-nifi-advanced-settings.cy.js**: 15 tests - Advanced JWT processor configuration and validation

**Total**: 25 tests passing consistently with 100% success rate

**Test Categories**:
- ‚úÖ JWT Token Validation (generate, validate, test various scenarios)
- ‚úÖ JWKS Endpoint Validation (URL validation, Keycloak integration)
- ‚úÖ Error Handling (network timeouts, missing properties, malformed JSON)
- ‚úÖ Multi-issuer Configuration (multiple issuers, property validation)
- ‚úÖ Advanced UI Navigation (three-tab system, flexible naming conventions)

## Standards and References

This project implements centralized coding standards:

- **Testing Standards**: [Testing Core Standards](https://github.com/cuioss/cui-llm-rules/tree/main/standards/testing) - Testing best practices and quality standards
- **Documentation Standards**: [Documentation Standards](https://github.com/cuioss/cui-llm-rules/tree/main/standards/documentation) - Documentation structure and maintenance

## Support

### For New Team Members
1. Start with [Setup Guide](./setup-guide.md)
2. Review [Testing Patterns](./testing-patterns.md) for practical examples
3. Reference [Architecture](./architecture.md) for technical details

### For Troubleshooting
1. Check [Testing Patterns](./testing-patterns.md) ‚Üí Troubleshooting section
2. Review [Setup Guide](./setup-guide.md) for configuration issues
3. Reference [JavaScript Testing](./javascript-testing.md) for component-specific problems

## Contributing

**Stepwise Development Process**:
1. Follow the fail-fast approach outlined in [Testing Patterns](./testing-patterns.md) ‚Üí Stepwise Development section
2. Make incremental changes to tests or commands
3. **Always verify each change** with both Maven commands:
   - `./mvnw clean verify` (full build verification)
   - `./mvnw clean verify -pl e-2-e-cypress -Pintegration-tests` (integration tests)
4. Fix any failures immediately before proceeding
5. **Commit only after both Maven commands pass successfully**
6. Follow patterns in [Testing Patterns](./testing-patterns.md)
7. Use existing custom commands from `/cypress/support/commands/`
8. Focus on testing custom processor logic, not NiFi mechanics
9. Ensure zero ESLint warnings following centralized standards

**Critical Rule**: Never modify or add parameters to either Maven verification command. All changes must work with both exact commands as specified.
