### Current Focus Areas
- 🎯 **Navigation Stabilization**: Fix controller services timeout (Priority 1)
- 🎯 **Processor State Detection**: Reliable configuration detection (Core Foundation)
- 🎯 **Test Simplification**: Focus on custom processor logic, minimize NiFi interaction

## 🛠 Technical Stack

- **Test Framework**: Cypress 14.4.1 with custom commands
- **Target Application**: NiFi 2.4.0 with Angular UI
- **Infrastructure**: Docker with NiFi + Keycloak
- **Build System**: Maven with Node.js integration
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with automated testing

## 🎯 Core Testing Philosophy

**We use NiFi as a platform to test our custom processor logic. We don't test NiFi itself.**

### Focus Areas
- ✅ Test JWT validation logic in our custom processors
- ✅ Test multi-issuer configuration handling  
- ✅ Test error handling and edge cases in our code
- ❌ Don't test NiFi's authentication system
- ❌ Don't test NiFi's navigation mechanics
- ❌ Don't test NiFi's processor framework

## 🤝 Contributing

### Writing New Tests
1. Follow patterns in [Testing Recipes](./recipes-and-howto.md)
2. Use existing custom commands from `/cypress/support/commands/`
3. Focus on testing custom processor logic, not NiFi mechanics
4. Include proper cleanup in `afterEach()` hooks

### Improving Documentation
1. Update relevant documentation when making changes
2. Add new patterns to [Testing Recipes](./recipes-and-howto.md)
3. Update [Next Steps](./tasks-and-next-steps.md) when completing tasks
4. Keep [Current Status](./current-status.md) current with new metrics

### Reporting Issues
1. Check [Testing Recipes](./recipes-and-howto.md) troubleshooting first
2. Include Cypress test output and environment details
3. Reference relevant documentation sections
4. Specify if issue affects custom processor testing vs NiFi interaction
