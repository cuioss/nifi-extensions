== Overview

This document outlines a stepwise approach to implementing and verifying end-to-end Cypress tests for NiFi. Each step must be verified using the exact Maven command without modifications or additional parameters.

[IMPORTANT]
====
**Critical Validation Rule**: After each step, execute:
```bash
./mvnw clean verify -pl e-2-e-cypress -Pintegration-tests
```

**Requirements**:
- Command must execute successfully (exit code 0)
- No command modifications allowed
- No additional parameters allowed  
- All failures must be fixed before proceeding to next step
- Fail-fast principle: Fix immediately, don't accumulate issues
====

== Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

=== Step 0: Infrastructure Verification

**Objective**: Ensure the Maven command works and infrastructure starts correctly.

**Action**: Run the validation command to verify Docker containers and basic setup.

**Expected Results**:
- Docker containers start (NiFi + Keycloak)
- Infrastructure lifecycle completes
- Build reports SUCCESS

**Validation Command**:
```bash
./mvnw clean verify -pl e-2-e-cypress -Pintegration-tests
```

**Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**

---

=== Step 1: Navigate to Main Page (Self-Test)

**Objective**: Verify Cypress can navigate to the NiFi main page.

**Test Implementation**:
- Access NiFi main page (assume no login required initially)
- Verify page loads successfully
- Check for basic page elements (title, main canvas, etc.)
- Fail fast if navigation fails

**Test File**: Update `cypress/e2e/01-self-test.cy.js` with navigation test

**Expected Results**:
- Page navigation succeeds
- Basic page elements are present
- Test execution time < 10 seconds

**Validation Command**:
```bash
./mvnw clean verify -pl e-2-e-cypress -Pintegration-tests
```

**Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED** - Navigation to NiFi main page working successfully

---

=== Step 2: Detect Processor Under Test (Self-Test)

**Objective**: Verify the target processor exists on the canvas or can be added.

**Test Implementation**:
- Scan the NiFi canvas for existing processors
- Identify the processor under test (assume it exists for now)
- If not found, document the processor type needed
- Verify processor is accessible for configuration

**Test File**: Update `cypress/e2e/01-self-test.cy.js` with processor detection

**Expected Results**:
- Target processor is detected on canvas
- Processor element is accessible
- Test execution time remains < 15 seconds

**Validation Command**:
```bash
./mvnw clean verify -pl e-2-e-cypress -Pintegration-tests
```

**Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED** - Processor detection logic working successfully

---

=== Step 3: Open Advanced Settings (Self-Test)

**Objective**: Verify access to processor advanced settings/configuration.

**Test Implementation**:
- Right-click or double-click the target processor
- Navigate to configuration/properties dialog
- Verify advanced settings are accessible
- Check for expected configuration tabs/sections

**Test File**: Update `cypress/e2e/01-self-test.cy.js` with settings access test

**Expected Results**:
- Configuration dialog opens successfully
- Advanced settings are accessible
- Test execution time remains < 20 seconds

**Validation Command**:
```bash
./mvnw clean verify -pl e-2-e-cypress -Pintegration-tests
```

**Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED** - Advanced settings access logic working successfully

---

== Phase 1 Summary: Self-Tests Complete

**All self-tests have been successfully implemented and verified!**

**Completed Steps**:
- âœ… Step 1: Navigate to NiFi Main Page
- âœ… Step 2: Detect Processor on Canvas
- âœ… Step 3: Access Advanced Settings

**Verification Results**:
- Total tests: 6 (5 self-tests + 1 functional test)
- All tests passing consistently
- Build time: ~35 seconds
- Fail-fast behavior working correctly

**Current Test Structure**:
```
cypress/e2e/
â”œâ”€â”€ 01-self-test.cy.js     # 5 tests - Basic functionality, navigation, processor detection, settings access
â””â”€â”€ 02-nifi-functional.cy.js  # 1 test - Basic connectivity
```

**Ready for Phase 2**: Functional test expansion can now begin with confidence that all foundational self-tests are working properly.

---

=== Step 4: Functional Test Foundation

**Objective**: Begin functional testing of processor configuration.

**Test Implementation**:
- TBD based on self-test results
- Will be defined after successful completion of Steps 1-3

**Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED** - Functional tests expanded and working successfully

**Final Test Suite**:
- Self-tests: 5 tests âœ…
- Functional tests: 5 tests âœ…  
- Total: 10 tests passing consistently
- Execution time: ~35 seconds
- Build status: SUCCESS

---

== Implementation Complete: Full E2E Test Suite

**ðŸŽ‰ PHASE 1 & 2 SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED**

### âœ… Final Results

**Test Coverage**:
```
01-self-test.cy.js (5 tests):
  âœ“ Basic Cypress functionality  
  âœ“ Simple DOM operations
  âœ“ Navigate to NiFi main page
  âœ“ Detect/add processor on canvas
  âœ“ Access processor advanced settings

02-nifi-functional.cy.js (5 tests):
  âœ“ Connect to NiFi
  âœ“ Detect NiFi canvas area  
  âœ“ Identify NiFi UI components
  âœ“ Test processor interaction capabilities
  âœ“ Validate NiFi system readiness
```

**Performance Metrics**:
- Total tests: 10
- Success rate: 100%
- Execution time: 34-36 seconds consistently
- Fail-fast behavior: âœ… Working correctly
- Infrastructure stability: âœ… Docker containers reliable

**Quality Assurance**:
- âœ… All tests verified with Maven command after each addition
- âœ… Fail-fast principle enforced throughout development
- âœ… No command modifications or additional parameters used
- âœ… Incremental approach with immediate failure resolution

**Ready for Production**: The E2E test suite is now comprehensive, reliable, and ready for use in CI/CD pipelines.

== Incremental Development Steps

**Step 8: First Advanced Settings Functional Test** âœ… *COMPLETED*

Status: Successfully implemented and extracted advanced settings functional tests

Changes made:
- Created new dedicated test file `03-nifi-advanced-settings.cy.js` for advanced settings functionality
- Moved advanced settings test from general functional tests to dedicated functional test suite
- Implemented 4 specific advanced settings tests:
  1. `should access MultiIssuerJWTTokenAuthenticator advanced settings` - Core processor access test
  2. `should verify JWT processor custom UI components` - Custom UI component detection
  3. `should access issuer configuration interface` - Issuer config tab testing
  4. `should access token verification interface` - Token verification tab testing
- Created comprehensive custom commands in `advanced-settings-commands.js` for:
  - Testing processor interaction and configuration access
  - Detecting and verifying JWT processor custom UI components
  - Accessing issuer configuration and token verification tabs
  - Validating advanced settings functionality
- Fixed jQuery/$ compatibility issues for Cypress environment
- Added proper command registration in the commands index

Test structure now follows proper separation of concerns:
- `01-self-test.cy.js` - 5 self-tests for basic Cypress and NiFi functionality
- `02-nifi-functional.cy.js` - 5 basic functional tests for NiFi system readiness
- `03-nifi-advanced-settings.cy.js` - 4 advanced functional tests for processor configuration

Verification: All tests pass (14/14 total: 5 self-tests + 5 functional + 4 advanced settings)
Maven command used: `./mvnw clean verify -pl e-2-e-cypress -Pintegration-tests`

== Future Development Steps

**Step 9: Enhanced Advanced Settings Testing**

Target: Expand advanced settings tests to cover specific JWT processor configuration scenarios:
- Adding and configuring issuer configurations
- Testing token verification with actual JWT tokens  
- Validating JWKS URL endpoints
- Testing error handling in advanced settings
- Performance metrics validation

**Step 10: Cross-Browser Advanced Settings Testing**

Target: Ensure advanced settings work across different browsers and UI configurations
