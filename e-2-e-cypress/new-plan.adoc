== Overview

This document outlines a streamlined approach to execute end-to-end Cypress tests using Maven. The focus is on ensuring the command `./mvnw clean verify -pl e-2-e-cypress -Pintegration-tests` runs successfully without additional configurations or environment variable exports.

== Critical Timing Constraint

[IMPORTANT]
====
**Critical Timing Constraint**: The NiFi runtime must be fully loaded before tests run. This means:

* **First successful NiFi UI access** = NiFi is fully loaded and responsive.
* **After first success**: All subsequent tests should use *very small timeouts* (2-5 seconds).
* **Fail-fast principle**: Tests should fail quickly if something is wrong, not hang for minutes.

== Phase 1: Infrastructure Verification

=== Task 1.1: Verify Infrastructure
**Objective**: Ensure Docker containers start successfully and infrastructure lifecycle works.

**Commands**:
```bash
./mvnw clean verify -pl e-2-e-cypress -Pintegration-tests
```

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] Docker containers start successfully (NiFi + Keycloak).
- [ ] Services become ready quickly.
- [ ] No Cypress tests executed.

**Success Criteria**:
- [x] Command executes without errors.
- [x] Infrastructure lifecycle works (start → verify → stop).
- [x] Build reports SUCCESS.

---

== Phase 2: Minimal Self-Test

=== Task 2.1: Execute Basic Self-Test
**Objective**: Validate Cypress execution with a single minimal test.

**Test File**: `01-basic-cypress.cy.js`
**Description**: Basic assertions, no external dependencies.

**Commands**:
```bash
./mvnw clean verify -pl e-2-e-cypress -Pintegration-tests
```

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] Single test executes successfully.
- [ ] Execution time: < 5 seconds.

**Success Criteria**:
- [x] Command executes without errors.
- [x] Test passes.
- [x] Build reports SUCCESS.

== Phase 6: Expanded Self-Tests

=== Task 6.1: Execute Navigation Test
**Objective**: Validate NiFi navigation with aggressive timeouts.

**Commands**:
```bash
./mvnw clean verify -pl e-2-e-cypress -Pintegration-tests
```

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] Navigation test executes successfully.
- [ ] Execution time: < 10 seconds.

**Success Criteria**:
- [x] Command executes without errors.
- [x] Test passes.
- [x] Build reports SUCCESS.

=== Task 6.2: Execute Elements Test
**Objective**: Add NiFi elements detection test to the suite.

**Commands**:
```bash
./mvnw clean verify -pl e-2-e-cypress -Pintegration-tests
```

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] Elements test executes successfully.
- [ ] Execution time: < 10 seconds.

**Success Criteria**:
- [x] Command executes without errors.
- [x] Test passes.
- [x] Build reports SUCCESS.

=== Task 6.3: Execute Interaction Test
**Objective**: Complete NiFi UI interaction suite.

**Commands**:
```bash
./mvnw clean verify -pl e-2-e-cypress -Pintegration-tests
```

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] Interaction test executes successfully.
- [ ] Execution time: < 15 seconds.

**Success Criteria**:
- [x] Command executes without errors.
- [x] Test passes.
- [x] Build reports SUCCESS.

== Notes

* Always use the command `./mvnw clean verify -pl e-2-e-cypress -Pintegration-tests`.
* Incrementally add tests and validate after each addition.
* Document any issues encountered and solutions applied.
* Update this plan as new tasks are identified.
* Test incrementally - never skip validation steps.

== Troubleshooting Guide

=== Common Issues and Solutions

==== Issue: Maven Module Not Found
**Symptom**: Error message "No projects in reactor"
**Solution**:
```bash
# Always run from workspace root
cd /Users/oliver/git/nifi-extensions
./mvnw clean verify -pl e-2-e-cypress -Pintegration-tests
```

==== Issue: Tests Timeout
**Symptom**: Tests fail with timeout errors
**Solution**:
- Verify NiFi server is running and accessible.
- Check for system load issues and retry.

==== Issue: Build Success but No Tests Executed
**Symptom**: Maven reports SUCCESS but no Cypress tests run
**Solution**:
- Ensure test files are correctly located in the `cypress` directory.
- Verify Maven configuration includes the correct test patterns.
