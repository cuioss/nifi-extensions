== Overview

This document defines the requirements for the integration testing module, which provides a Docker-based test environment for validating NiFi extensions.

== Implementation Requirements

This section outlines the concrete requirements that need to be implemented, with checkboxes to track status.

=== Container Configuration
* [x] NiFi version must be 2.4.0
* [x] Keycloak version must be 26.0.1

=== File Paths and Volumes
* [x] Path for NAR to be copied to/read from: `target/nifi-deploy/`
* [x] This path should be mounted as a volume to allow NAR updates without container restart
* [x] NiFi configuration source must be `integration-testing/src/main/docker/nifi/conf`
* [x] Keycloak realm file `integration-testing/src/main/docker/keycloak/oauth_integration_tests-realm.json` must be copied to Keycloak for bootstrap

=== Build and Deployment
* [x] Create a separate script for building and copying the NAR to the deployment location

== Functional Requirements

=== Docker Environment

==== Container Setup
* [x] The environment must include a NiFi container and a Keycloak container
* [x] Both containers must be configured to work together in a shared network
* [x] The NiFi container must expose HTTPS on port 9095
* [x] The Keycloak container must expose HTTP on port 9080 and HTTPS on port 9085

==== NiFi Configuration
* [x] NiFi must be configured with HTTPS enabled
* [x] NiFi must have a default admin user for authentication
* [x] The nifi-cuioss-nar extension must be deployed to the NiFi container

==== Keycloak Configuration
* [x] Keycloak must be configured with a test realm
* [x] The realm must include a test user and client for token generation

==== Certificate Configuration
* [x] Both NiFi and Keycloak must use the same locally generated certificate for localhost
* [x] The certificate must be automatically generated during container startup
* [x] The certificate must be properly configured for both services

=== Deployment Process

==== Build Process
* [x] The environment must build the NAR file before starting containers
* [x] The NAR file must be copied to the appropriate deployment location

==== Container Management
* [x] The environment must provide scripts for starting and stopping containers
* [x] The start script must ensure all necessary directories exist

== Verification Requirements

=== Verification Process
* [x] Use `run-test-container.sh` to start the verification
* [x] Always stop the container after verification using `stop-test-container.sh`
* [x] Verify that the NAR file is present under `target/nifi-deploy/`

=== Container Verification
* [x] Both NiFi and Keycloak containers must start successfully without errors
* [x] Verification must be performed using `docker compose logs nifi` and `docker compose logs keycloak`

=== NAR Deployment Verification
* [x] The nifi-cuioss-nar file must be successfully deployed to the NiFi container
* [x] Verification must be performed using `docker compose logs nifi | grep -i "nifi-cuioss-nar"`

=== Certificate Verification
* [x] Verify that both NiFi and Keycloak are using the generated certificates
* [x] Verification must be performed using the `verify-certificates.sh` script

== Non-Functional Requirements

=== Usability
* [x] The environment must be easy to set up and use
* [x] Clear documentation must be provided for all operations

=== Maintainability
* [x] The environment must use volume mounts for configuration to simplify updates
* [x] Container configuration must be externalized in docker-compose.yml

=== Performance
* [x] The environment should start up in a reasonable time frame
* [x] Resource usage should be minimized where possible
