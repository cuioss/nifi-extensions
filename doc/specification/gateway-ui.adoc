== Purpose

The Custom UI is a configuration assistant for the `RestApiGatewayProcessor`.
It provides a CRUD editor for route definitions (`restapi.*` properties) and
an endpoint tester to send authenticated requests against the running gateway.

== Persistence Model

The REST API Gateway reads its route configuration from NiFi processor
properties at start-up and configures a static Jetty server accordingly.

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Persisted routes | Defined in processor properties (`restapi.<name>.*`).
  Survive processor restarts.
| Session-only changes | Routes added or modified through the Custom UI during
  the current session. Lost when the processor is restarted or the dialog is
  closed.
|===

=== Origin Indicators

Each route row in the summary table shows a visual badge indicating its origin:

[cols="1,1,3"]
|===
| Badge | CSS class | Meaning

| Lock icon (muted)
| `.origin-persisted`
| Loaded from processor properties, unmodified.

| **Modified** (amber)
| `.origin-modified`
| Originally from properties, but edited in the current UI session.

| **New** (blue)
| `.origin-new`
| Created via "Add Route" during the current UI session.
|===

== Property Export

The **Export Properties** panel (collapsible `<details>` at the bottom of the
editor) generates a text representation of all routes. Session-only routes
(new or modified) are prefixed with `# [session-only]` so users can identify
which lines need to be copied into the processor configuration to persist them.

== Schema Modes

Each route optionally supports JSON Schema validation. The schema value can be
provided in two modes:

* **File path** — a path relative to the NiFi installation directory,
  e.g. `./conf/schemas/my-schema.json`.
* **Inline JSON** — the full JSON Schema pasted directly into a textarea.

The mode is auto-detected on load (values starting with `{` are treated as
inline) and can be toggled via radio buttons in the editor form.
