== Security Overview

_See Requirement: link:../Requirements.adoc#NIFI-AUTH-8[NIFI-AUTH-8: Security Requirements]_

== Token Validation Security
[.requirement]
_See Requirement: link:../Requirements.adoc#NIFI-AUTH-8[NIFI-AUTH-8: Security Requirements]_

=== JWT Validation Best Practices

The processor implements these JWT validation security best practices:

1. **Signature Verification**: All tokens are validated against trusted issuer keys
2. **Expiration Checking**: Expired tokens are rejected
3. **Issuer Verification**: Only configured issuers are accepted
4. **Audience Validation**: Tokens must include the expected audience claim
5. **Key Rotation Support**: Automated JWKS key rotation
6. **Algorithm Restrictions**: Only secure algorithms are allowed

=== Algorithm Restrictions

The processor restricts token algorithms to those considered secure:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Algorithm |Security Status

|RS256, RS384, RS512
|Secure - RSA with SHA-2

|ES256, ES384, ES512
|Secure - ECDSA with SHA-2

|PS256, PS384, PS512
|Secure - RSA PSS with SHA-2

|HS256, HS384, HS512
|**Not recommended** - Requires shared secret

|none
|**Blocked** - "none" algorithm is never allowed
|===

== JWKS Endpoint Security
[.requirement]
_See Requirement: link:../Requirements.adoc#NIFI-AUTH-8[NIFI-AUTH-8: Security Requirements]_

The processor implements these JWKS endpoint security measures:

1. **HTTPS Enforcement**: Production environments should use HTTPS for JWKS endpoints
2. **Certificate Validation**: TLS certificates are validated by default
3. **Key Caching**: Keys are cached to prevent DoS attacks
4. **Timeout Handling**: HTTP connections have reasonable timeouts
5. **Response Validation**: JWKS responses are validated before use

=== JWKS HTTP Client Configuration

The processor's HTTP client for JWKS endpoints is configured with these security settings:

[source,java]
----
/**
 * Creates a secure HTTP client for JWKS endpoint communication.
 * 
 * @return Configured HttpClient
 */
private HttpClient createSecureHttpClient() {
    return HttpClient.newBuilder()
        .connectTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(10))
        .followRedirects(HttpClient.Redirect.NORMAL)
        .build();
}
----

For more details on JWKS configuration, see link:configuration.adoc[Configuration].

== Custom UI Endpoint Security

The processor's Custom UI is deployed as a WAR file within NiFi's web container and is accessed via an iframe within the authenticated NiFi session.

=== Exposed Endpoints

The Custom UI exposes these administration endpoints:

[cols="2,3"]
|===
|Endpoint |Purpose

|`/nifi-api/processors/jwt/verify-token`
|JWT token verification

|`/nifi-api/processors/jwt/validate-jwks-url`
|JWKS URL validation

|`/nifi-api/processors/jwt/validate-jwks-file`
|JWKS file validation

|`/nifi-api/processors/jwt/validate-jwks-content`
|JWKS content validation

|`/nifi-api/processors/jwt/metrics`
|Validation metrics
|===

=== Security Model

The endpoints are protected through multiple layers:

1. **NiFi Session Authentication**: The Custom UI runs inside NiFi's web container as an iframe within an authenticated NiFi session. Unauthenticated users cannot reach the Custom UI at all.
2. **Processor ID Validation**: The `ApiKeyAuthenticationFilter` requires an `X-Processor-Id` header on every request. This is a UUID passed to the iframe via URL parameter (`?id=<uuid>`), only available to authenticated NiFi users.
3. **Security Response Headers**: The `SecurityHeadersFilter` adds defense-in-depth headers (`X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`, `Referrer-Policy`) to all responses.
4. **Full Signature Verification**: All token verification uses the processor's real configuration with full cryptographic signature verification. No test or bypass modes exist.

=== JWKS File Path Protection

JWKS file validation uses a two-layer defense against path traversal:

1. **Security Pipeline Validation**: The `cui-http` library's `PipelineFactory.createUrlPathPipeline()` detects path traversal patterns including `../`, URL-encoded variants, and Unicode normalization attacks.
2. **Base Directory Restriction**: File access is restricted to the NiFi configuration directory (resolved from `nifi.properties.file.path` or configurable via `nifi.jwks.allowed.base.path`).

=== JWKS URL Protection

JWKS URL validation uses the `cui-http` library's `HttpHandler` for secure HTTP communication with built-in timeouts and URL structure validation via `PipelineFactory.createUrlPathPipeline()`.

=== Design Decisions

* No test or E2E bypass endpoints exist in production deployments
* `X-Frame-Options` is set to `SAMEORIGIN` (not `DENY`) because the Custom UI runs inside an iframe within NiFi
* Token logging uses masking (first 8 characters only) to prevent sensitive data exposure

== Multi-Issuer Security
[.requirement]
_See Requirement: link:../Requirements.adoc#NIFI-AUTH-8[NIFI-AUTH-8: Security Requirements]_

The multi-issuer support introduces additional security considerations:

1. **Issuer Isolation**: Each issuer is validated independently
2. **Key Separation**: Each issuer has its own key set
3. **Dynamic Configuration**: Issuers can be enabled/disabled without redeployment
4. **Per-Issuer Audience**: Each issuer can have specific audience requirements

=== Issuer Security Configuration

Each issuer can have specific security settings:

[source,properties]
----
# Production issuer with strict settings
auth server production = https://auth.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json
auth server production.audience = api://my-service-prod

# Development issuer with relaxed settings (disabled in production)
auth server development = https://auth-dev.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json
auth server development.enabled = false
----

== Runtime Security
[.requirement]
_See Requirement: link:../Requirements.adoc#NIFI-AUTH-8[NIFI-AUTH-8: Security Requirements]_

=== Resource Protection

The processor implements resource protection measures:

1. **Memory Usage Limits**: Token size limits prevent memory exhaustion attacks
2. **CPU Protection**: Parsing complexity is limited to prevent CPU attacks
3. **Caching Optimization**: Effective caching reduces resource usage
4. **Error Rate Limiting**: Failed validation attempts are tracked

=== Memory Usage Considerations

The processor protects against memory-related attacks:

[source,properties]
----
# Limit token size to prevent memory exhaustion
Maximum Token Size=16384
----

For more details on performance and resource considerations, see link:configuration.adoc[Configuration].

== Security Event Monitoring
[.requirement]
_See Requirement: link:../Requirements.adoc#NIFI-AUTH-10[NIFI-AUTH-10: Error Handling Requirements]_

The processor tracks security events for monitoring and alerting:

1. **Invalid Token Count**: Tracks tokens with invalid signatures
2. **Expired Token Count**: Tracks expired tokens separately
3. **Malformed Token Count**: Tracks unparseable tokens
4. **Unauthorized Access Attempts**: Tracks authorization failures

For details on security event monitoring implementation, see link:token-validation.adoc[Token Validation - Security Event Monitoring].

== Security Recommendations

=== Deployment Recommendations

1. **Use HTTPS for JWKS Endpoints**: Always use HTTPS for JWKS endpoints in production
2. **Regular Key Rotation**: Configure appropriate key rotation intervals
3. **Specific Audience Claims**: Use specific audience claims rather than generic ones
4. **Limit Token Size**: Set appropriate maximum token size
5. **Monitor Security Events**: Track validation failures for security insights

=== Configuration Best Practices

1. **Disable Unused Issuers**: Disable any issuers not needed in production
2. **Require Valid Token**: Set "Require Valid Token" to true in production
3. **Use Specific Scopes**: Configure required scopes for authorization
4. **Set Up Role-Based Access**: Use roles for fine-grained authorization

For more details on configuration, see link:configuration.adoc[Configuration].

== Testing Security
[.requirement]
_See Requirement: link:../Requirements.adoc#NIFI-AUTH-12[NIFI-AUTH-12: Integration Examples]_

The processor's security features are tested through:

1. **Unit Tests**: Verify security validations function correctly
2. **Integration Tests**: Test with real token issuers
3. **Security Tests**: Specifically test security edge cases
4. **Performance Tests**: Verify resource protection

For more details on security testing, see link:testing.adoc[Testing].
