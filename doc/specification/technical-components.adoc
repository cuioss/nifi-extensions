== Component Architecture
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#NIFI-AUTH-2[NIFI-AUTH-2: Core Functionality]_

== Overview
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#NIFI-AUTH-2[NIFI-AUTH-2: Core Functionality]_

This document describes the technical components of the MultiIssuerJWTTokenAuthenticator processor, their responsibilities, and how they interact to provide JWT token validation capabilities in NiFi. The processor is designed for NiFi 2.4.0 and leverages the cui-jwt-validation library for token validation functionality.

== Processor Implementation
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#NIFI-AUTH-2[NIFI-AUTH-2: Core Functionality]_

== Core Components
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#NIFI-AUTH-2[NIFI-AUTH-2: Core Functionality]_

=== TokenValidator
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#NIFI-AUTH-3[NIFI-AUTH-3: Token Validation Requirements]_

The TokenValidator serves as the primary entry point for token operations. It provides:

* Centralized token validation
* Multi-issuer support
* Token parsing and verification
* Automatic key retrieval and caching
* Claim validation including audience checks

For detailed implementation of token validation, see link:token-validation.adoc[Token Validation Specification].

=== IssuerConfig
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#NIFI-AUTH-3[NIFI-AUTH-3: Token Validation Requirements]_

The IssuerConfig handles token validation for a specific issuer. It allows configuration of:

* JWKS endpoints for dynamic key retrieval
* Static public keys for environments without JWKS endpoints
* Audience validation settings
* Custom claim validation rules
* Key refresh intervals

For more configuration details, see link:configuration.adoc[Configuration Specification].

=== Multi-Issuer Support
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#NIFI-AUTH-4[NIFI-AUTH-4: Multiple Issuer Support]_

The MultiIssuerJWTTokenAuthenticator supports multiple issuers simultaneously, allowing validation of tokens from different identity providers without complex flow configuration.

For detailed implementation examples and integration patterns, see link:integration-patterns.adoc[Integration Patterns].

== TokenValidator Lifecycle in NiFi
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#NIFI-AUTH-11[NIFI-AUTH-11: NiFi Integration]_

The cui-jwt-validation library's `TokenValidator` is designed to be stateful and maintain caches for performance optimization. In the MultiIssuerJWTTokenAuthenticator processor, the TokenValidator instance is managed with careful attention to NiFi's processor lifecycle.

For complete details on TokenValidator lifecycle management, including thread safety and resource management, see link:token-validation.adoc#handling-tokenvalidator-lifecycle-in-nifi[Handling TokenValidator Lifecycle in NiFi].

== Relationships
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#NIFI-AUTH-6[NIFI-AUTH-6: Output Requirements]_

[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Relationship |Description

|success
|FlowFiles that have been successfully processed with valid token data attached

|failure
|FlowFiles that contained invalid tokens or encountered errors during processing

|unauthorized
|FlowFiles that contained tokens that failed validation (expired, invalid signature, etc.)
|===

[source,java]
----
public static final Relationship SUCCESS = new Relationship.Builder()
    .name("success")
    .description("FlowFiles with valid tokens will be routed to this relationship")
    .build();

public static final Relationship AUTHENTICATION_FAILED = new Relationship.Builder()
    .name("authentication-failed")
    .description("FlowFiles with invalid tokens will be routed to this relationship")
    .build();

@Override
public Set<Relationship> getRelationships() {
    final Set<Relationship> relationships = new HashSet<>();
    relationships.add(SUCCESS);
    relationships.add(AUTHENTICATION_FAILED);
    return relationships;
}

== Flow File Attribute Handling

=== Input Attributes
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#NIFI-AUTH-5[NIFI-AUTH-5: Input Requirements]_

* None required - token extracted from HTTP header or configured location

=== Output Attributes
_See Requirements link:../Requirements.adoc#NIFI-AUTH-6.1[NIFI-AUTH-6.1: Success Path] and link:../Requirements.adoc#NIFI-AUTH-6.2[NIFI-AUTH-6.2: Failure Path]_

For detailed information about attribute handling and token validation output, see link:token-validation.adoc#flow-file-attribute-generation[Flow File Attribute Generation].

== Error Handling

The processor implements comprehensive error handling using standardized error codes and consistent messages. For complete details on error handling strategies and implementation, see link:error-handling.adoc[Error Handling Specification].

== Security Considerations

Security is paramount in JWT token validation. For information about security implementation, best practices, and threat mitigations, see link:security.adoc[Security Specification].
