== Summary

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Status | `422`
| Title | Unprocessable Content
| Produced by | `ProblemDetail.validationError()`
|===

== Description

The request body was syntactically valid but failed semantic validation
against the JSON Schema configured for this route. Schema validation is
optional and only performed when a route has a `restapi.<name>.schema`
property configured.

== Common Causes

* Missing required fields in the JSON body
* Field values with incorrect types (e.g., string where number expected)
* Values outside allowed ranges or pattern constraints
* Additional properties when `additionalProperties: false` is set

== Example Response

{
  "type": "https://github.com/cuioss/nifi-extensions/blob/main/doc/rest-errors/validation-error.adoc",
  "title": "Unprocessable Content",
  "status": 422,
  "detail": "Schema validation failed"
}
----

== Resolution

Ensure the request body conforms to the JSON Schema configured for the target route.
Review the `detail` field for specific validation errors.
