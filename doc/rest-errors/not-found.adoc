== Summary

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Status | `404`
| Title | Not Found
| Produced by | `ProblemDetail.notFound()`
|===

== Description

No route is configured for the requested URL path.
The gateway matches incoming request paths against configured routes
(`restapi.<name>.path` dynamic properties). If no route matches,
the request is rejected with a 404 response.

== Common Causes

* The URL path does not match any configured route
* A route was removed or renamed without updating API consumers
* Typo in the request URL

== Example Response

[source,json]

  "type": "https://github.com/cuioss/nifi-extensions/blob/main/doc/rest-errors/not-found.adoc",
  "title": "Not Found",
  "status": 404,
  "detail": "No route configured for path: /api/unknown"
}
----

== Resolution

Verify the request URL matches one of the configured routes.
Routes are defined via `restapi.<name>.path` dynamic properties
on the RestApiGateway processor.
