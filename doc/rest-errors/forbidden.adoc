== Summary

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Status | `403`
| Title | Forbidden
| Produced by | `ProblemDetail.forbidden()`
|===

== Description

The authenticated user does not have the required roles to access this route.
Authentication succeeded (the JWT token is valid), but the token's claims
do not satisfy the route's authorization requirements.

== Common Causes

* The JWT token lacks one or more roles required by the route configuration
  (configured via `restapi.<name>.roles`)
* The user's account has been assigned insufficient privileges

== Example Response

[source,json]

  "title": "Forbidden",
  "status": 403,
  "detail": "Insufficient roles: missing [admin]"
}
----

== Resolution

Ensure the JWT token contains the roles required by the route.
Route role requirements are configured via the `restapi.<name>.roles`
dynamic property on the processor.
