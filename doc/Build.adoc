This document provides information about building and developing the nifi-extensions.

== Updating the Maven Wrapper

To update the Maven Wrapper scripts (mvnw, mvnw.cmd, .mvn/wrapper), run the following command:

[source,shell]
----
./mvnw wrapper:wrapper
----

This will update the Maven Wrapper to the latest version provided by the takari-maven-wrapper-plugin.


== PlantUML Diagrams

This project uses PlantUML for creating diagrams in the documentation.
To ensure compatibility with GitHub's rendering capabilities, we follow these practices:

=== PlantUML File Structure

All PlantUML diagrams are stored in separate files under the `/doc/plantuml/` directory with the `.puml` extension.
This separation allows for:

* Better version control of diagrams
* Easier maintenance and updates
* Compatibility with GitHub's rendering limitations
* Generation of PNG images for documentation

Each PlantUML file should include the following directive at the beginning to ensure it can be rendered without requiring a local Graphviz installation:

[source]
----
@startuml
' Configure PlantUML to use its own rendering engine
!pragma layout smetana
...
@enduml
----

The `!pragma layout smetana` directive tells PlantUML to use its own internal rendering engine (Smetana) instead of relying on Graphviz, which eliminates the dependency on the local filesystem.

=== Generating PNG Images

If you have PlantUML installed locally, you can use the provided script to generate PNG images:

[source,bash]
----
./doc/plantuml/generate-plantuml.sh
----

This script will:

1. Find all `.puml` files in the `/doc/plantuml/` directory
2. Generate corresponding PNG images with the same base name using the locally installed PlantUML
3. Place the generated images in the same directory

This method is faster and doesn't require a Maven build.

=== Referencing Images in Documentation

To reference the generated PNG images in AsciiDoc documentation, use the following syntax:

For documents in the root directory (like README.adoc):

[source]
----
image::doc/plantuml/diagram-name.png[Diagram Title]
----

For documents in the `doc` directory:

[source]
----
image::plantuml/diagram-name.png[Diagram Title]
----

=== Adding New Diagrams

To add a new diagram:

1. Create a new `.puml` file in the `/doc/plantuml/` directory
2. Add your PlantUML content to the file
3. Generate the PNG image by running the `./doc/plantuml/generate-plantuml.sh` script (requires PlantUML installed locally)
4. Reference the generated PNG in your documentation
