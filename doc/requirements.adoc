== Overview
This document outlines the requirements for the JWT Validation Processor, a component designed to enhance Apache NiFi's capabilities in handling REST API authentication through JWT tokens.

== General Requirements

=== REST API Support Enhancement
* Enable simplified REST API endpoint provisioning in NiFi
* Provide standardized JWT validation capabilities
* Support OAuth 2.0 token validation workflow

== MultiIssuerJWTTokenAuthenticator

=== Core Functionality
* Name: MultiIssuerJWTTokenAuthenticator
* Extract JWT (JSON Web Token) from HTTP Bearer token header
* Validate token structure and signature
* Extract token information
* Route flow files based on validation results

=== Token Validation Requirements
* Verify token structure (header, payload, signature)
* Validate token signature using issuer public key/certificate
* Check token expiration (exp claim)
* Verify token issuer (iss claim)
* Validate token audience if present (aud claim)
* Support multiple token issuers

=== Multiple Issuer Support
* Configure multiple trusted issuers
* Store issuer-specific validation configurations
* Support different signing algorithms per issuer
* Allow dynamic issuer key/certificate updates

=== Input Requirements
* Accept JWT token in flow file
* Support configurable token location in flow file
* Handle various token formats (Bearer, raw JWT)

=== Output Requirements
==== Success Path
* Route validated tokens to "success" relationship
* Extract and provide token claims as flow file attributes
* Include validation metadata (issuer, validation time)

==== Failure Path
* Route invalid tokens to "authentication-failed" relationship
* Provide detailed failure reason as flow file attribute
* Support different failure categories:
** Invalid token structure
** Expired token
** Invalid signature
** Unknown issuer
** Invalid claims

=== Configuration Requirements
==== UI Configuration
* All configuration must be done through the NiFi UI
* Provide user-friendly configuration interface
* Support dynamic configuration updates

==== Token Validation Configuration
* Configure multiple issuers through UI
* Each issuer configuration consists of:
** Issuer identifier (String)
** One of:
*** JWKS endpoint URL for key retrieval
*** Direct public key configuration for signature verification
* Support dynamic addition/removal of issuers
* Validate configuration inputs
* Provide clear error messages for invalid configurations

==== Authorization Configuration
* Require Valid Token (Boolean)
** When true: Valid token results in success relationship
** When false: Token validation result is informational only
* Required Scopes (List of String)
** List of OAuth scopes that must be present in token
** Empty list means no specific scopes required
* Required Roles (List of String)
** List of roles that must be present in token
** Empty list means no specific roles required
* All configured requirements (scopes and roles) must be met for success

==== Token Location
* Extract token from Bearer Authorization header
* Format: "Bearer <token>"
* Support validation of header presence and format

==== Configuration Properties
* List of trusted issuers (Dynamic Property)
* Per issuer configuration:
** Issuer identifier
** JWKS endpoint URL or public key
** Validation rules
* Token location configuration
* Required claims configuration
* Output attribute mapping

=== Security Requirements
* Secure storage of issuer certificates/keys
* No sensitive information logging
* Proper error handling without information leakage
* Compliance with security best practices

=== Performance Requirements
* Efficient token validation
* Minimal memory footprint
* Quick failure detection for invalid tokens
* Scalable multi-issuer support

== Integration Requirements

=== NiFi Integration
* Compatible with NiFi's processor lifecycle
* Proper error handling and recovery
* Support for NiFi's configuration framework
* Integration with NiFi's security features

=== Documentation Requirements
* Clear configuration guide
* Usage examples
* Troubleshooting guide
* Security considerations
* Performance tuning recommendations

== Testing Requirements

=== Unit Testing
* Complete test coverage for all validation scenarios
* Mock issuer configurations
* Error handling verification
* Performance testing

=== Integration Testing
* End-to-end flow testing
* Multiple issuer scenarios
* Error handling scenarios
* Load testing

== Success Criteria
* Successful JWT validation with multiple issuers
* Proper routing of valid/invalid tokens
* Clear error messaging for invalid tokens
* Meets performance requirements
* Passes all security requirements
* Complete documentation
* Test coverage meets standards (minimum 80%)
