== Overview
This document outlines the requirements for the JWT Validation Processor, a component designed to enhance Apache NiFi's capabilities in handling REST API authentication through JWT tokens.

== General Requirements

[#NIFI-AUTH-1]
=== NIFI-AUTH-1: REST API Support Enhancement
* Enable simplified REST API endpoint provisioning in NiFi
* Provide standardized JWT validation capabilities
* Support OAuth 2.0 token validation workflow

== MultiIssuerJWTTokenAuthenticator

[#NIFI-AUTH-2]
=== NIFI-AUTH-2: Core Functionality
* Name: MultiIssuerJWTTokenAuthenticator
* Extract JWT (JSON Web Token) from HTTP Bearer token header
* Validate token structure and signature
* Extract token information
* Route flow files based on validation results

[#NIFI-AUTH-3]
=== NIFI-AUTH-3: Token Validation Requirements
* Verify token structure (header, payload, signature)
* Validate token signature using issuer public key/certificate
* Check token expiration (exp claim)
* Verify token issuer (iss claim)
* Validate token audience if present (aud claim)
* Support multiple token issuers

[#NIFI-AUTH-4]
=== NIFI-AUTH-4: Multiple Issuer Support
* Configure multiple trusted issuers
* Store issuer-specific validation configurations
* Support different signing algorithms per issuer
* Allow dynamic issuer key/certificate updates

[#NIFI-AUTH-5]
=== NIFI-AUTH-5: Input Requirements
* Accept JWT token in flow file
* Support configurable token location in flow file
* Handle various token formats (Bearer, raw JWT)

[#NIFI-AUTH-6]
=== NIFI-AUTH-6: Output Requirements

[#NIFI-AUTH-6.1]
==== NIFI-AUTH-6.1: Success Path
* Route validated tokens to "success" relationship
* Extract and provide token claims as flow file attributes
* Include validation metadata (issuer, validation time)

[#NIFI-AUTH-6.2]
==== NIFI-AUTH-6.2: Failure Path
* Route invalid tokens to "authentication-failed" relationship
* Provide detailed failure reason as flow file attribute
* Support different failure categories:
** Invalid token structure
** Expired token
** Invalid signature
** Unknown issuer
** Invalid claims

[#NIFI-AUTH-7]
=== NIFI-AUTH-7: Configuration Requirements

[#NIFI-AUTH-7.1]
==== NIFI-AUTH-7.1: UI Configuration
* All configuration must be done through the NiFi UI
* Provide user-friendly configuration interface
* Support dynamic configuration updates
* Include a "Test Connection" button for JWKS endpoint URLs
** Button should validate that the JWKS endpoint is accessible
** Provide immediate feedback on connection success/failure
** Display appropriate error messages for connection failures

[#NIFI-AUTH-7.2]
==== NIFI-AUTH-7.2: Token Validation Configuration
* Configure multiple issuers through UI
* Each issuer configuration consists of:
** Issuer Identifier (String)
** One of:
*** JWKS endpoint URL for key retrieval
*** Direct public key configuration for signature verification
* Support dynamic addition/removal of issuers
* Validate configuration inputs
* Provide clear error messages for invalid configurations

[#NIFI-AUTH-7.3]
==== NIFI-AUTH-7.3: Verification
* Provide a token testing interface in the UI
* Include a text area for pasting JWT tokens
* Add a "Verify Token" button to test token against current configuration
* For valid tokens:
** Display token validation success message
** Show decoded token payload (claims)
** Display which issuer validated the token
** Show what attributes would be added to the flow file
* For invalid tokens:
** Display validation failure reason
** Show detailed error information
** Suggest possible fixes based on error type
* Support testing without affecting processor state or flow files

[#NIFI-AUTH-7.4]
==== NIFI-AUTH-7.4: Authorization Configuration
* Require Valid Token (Boolean)
** When true: Valid token results in success relationship
** When false: Token validation result is informational only
* Required Scopes (List of String)
** List of OAuth scopes that must be present in token
** Empty list means no specific scopes required
* Required Roles (List of String)
** List of roles that must be present in token
** Empty list means no specific roles required
* All configured requirements (scopes and roles) must be met for success

[#NIFI-AUTH-7.5]
==== NIFI-AUTH-7.5: Token Location
* Extract token from Bearer Authorization header
* Format: "Bearer <token>"
* Support validation of header presence and format

[#NIFI-AUTH-7.6]
==== NIFI-AUTH-7.6: Configuration Properties
* List of Issuer Identifiers (Dynamic Property)
* Per issuer configuration:
** Issuer Identifier
** JWKS endpoint URL or public key

[#NIFI-AUTH-8]
=== NIFI-AUTH-8: Security Requirements
* Secure storage of issuer certificates/keys
* No sensitive information logging
* Proper error handling without information leakage
* Compliance with security best practices

[#NIFI-AUTH-9]
=== NIFI-AUTH-9: Performance Requirements
* Efficient token validation
* Minimal memory footprint
* Quick failure detection for invalid tokens
* Scalable multi-issuer support
* Specific performance metrics:
** Token validation throughput: >1000 tokens/second
** JWKS cache refresh: <5 seconds
** Token validation latency: <50ms per token
** Memory usage: <100MB additional heap usage

[#NIFI-AUTH-10]
=== NIFI-AUTH-10: Error Handling Requirements
* Standardized error codes for all failure scenarios
* Descriptive error messages without sensitive information
* Error categories with specific codes:
** INFO level messages: 001-099
** WARN level messages: 100-199
** ERROR level messages: 200-299
