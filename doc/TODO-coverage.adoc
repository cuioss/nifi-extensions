= Addressing JavaScript Test Coverage in nifi-cuioss-ui

== 1. Analysis of the Current Situation

*   Core Problem: Jest's difficulty in correctly loading legacy AMD modules in the `nifi-cuioss-ui` project. This results in inaccurate (often 0%) test coverage reports because the actual module code isn't executed during tests.
*   Previously Attempted Solutions:
    *   Custom `global.define` in `setup.js`: While this could execute the AMD factory and produce a module instance, Jest's `require()` still returned an empty object in test files.
    *   `@babel/plugin-transform-modules-amd`: This Babel plugin, intended to convert AMD to CommonJS, repeatedly led to `ReferenceError: define is not defined` errors, suggesting issues with the transformation process or conflicts within the Jest environment.
*   Consideration for Refactoring: If resolving AMD loading issues within the current structure proves too complex or unstable, a broader refactoring of the JavaScript module system (e.g., migrating to ES Modules) and testing strategy for `nifi-cuioss-ui` should be considered.

== 2. Actionable Items (TODO List)

*   [ ] **Create `doc/TODO-coverage.adoc` Document:** (This task) Document the plan and actionable items.
*   [ ] **Explore the existing Codebase Structure:** Examine `pom.xml`, `babel.config.js`, `jest.config.js`, `setup.js`, and example AMD modules/tests to understand the current setup.
*   [ ] **Create a Minimal Reproducible Example:**
    *   Set up a small, isolated project with one simple AMD module, a Jest test, and Babel configured with `@babel/plugin-transform-modules-amd`.
    *   Goal: Achieve successful AMD to CommonJS transformation, test execution, and accurate coverage reporting.
    *   Document the working configuration.
*   [ ] **Investigate `ReferenceError: define is not defined` in `nifi-cuioss-ui`:**
    *   Apply learnings from the minimal example.
    *   Pinpoint the cause: Babel plugin order, files not being processed, or conflicts with `setup.js`.
*   [ ] **Ensure Clean `setup.js` for `nifi-cuioss-ui`:**
    *   When `@babel/plugin-transform-modules-amd` is active, ensure `src/test/javascript/setup.js` is minimal and free of conflicting AMD-related logic.
*   [ ] **Apply Solution to `jwksValidator.js`:**
    *   Use the refined Babel/Jest configuration to enable testing and coverage for `nifi-cuioss-ui/src/main/javascript/jwksValidator.js`.
    *   Verify that tests pass and coverage is reported.
*   [ ] **Refactor Tests for `jwksValidator.js` (If Necessary):**
    *   Review and update tests to remove excessive mocking that may have been implemented due to loading issues. Ensure tests effectively exercise the module's logic.
*   [ ] **Extend Solution to Other AMD Modules in `nifi-cuioss-ui`:**
    *   Systematically apply the working configuration to other AMD modules and their tests.
*   [ ] **Full Project Verification:**
    *   Run `./mvnw clean install` (or the relevant Maven command) to ensure the entire `nifi-cuioss-ui` project (and potentially its parent) builds and tests successfully.
*   [ ] **Evaluate JavaScript/Testing Structure (Final Step):**
    *   Critically assess if the AMD module structure and current testing approach are sustainable long-term.
    *   If significant issues persist, document the reasons and propose a refactoring strategy (e.g., migration to ES modules).

== 3. Committing Changes

*   All changes related to this effort should be committed to the `feature/js-coverage-report-path` branch.
*   Each actionable item, once completed and verified, should be committed individually or in logical small groups.
