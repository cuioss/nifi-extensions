== Overview

This document lists the actionable tasks required to fully implement the MultiIssuerJWTTokenAuthenticator according to the requirements and specifications. All tasks are traceable to requirements/specifications and use standard status indicators.

== Implementation Tasks

=== Core Components

==== C1. MultiIssuerJWTTokenAuthenticator Processor
[ ] _Priority:_ High

_Description:_ Implement the processor class and relationships, integrate cui-jwt-validation for token validation, support multiple issuers and dynamic issuer configuration, implement property descriptors and dynamic properties, output attributes for success/failure, and error handling with standardized error codes.

_Rationale:_ This is the core component that provides JWT validation and routing, fulfilling the main requirements for authentication and authorization in NiFi flows. See Requirements NIFI-AUTH-2, NIFI-AUTH-3, NIFI-AUTH-4 in link:Requirements.adoc[Requirements].

_Specification Reference:_
- link:specification/technical-components.adoc#_multiissuerjwttokenauthenticator[Technical Components: MultiIssuerJWTTokenAuthenticator]

- link:specification/configuration.adoc#_core_properties[Configuration: Core Properties]
- link:specification/error-handling.adoc[Error Handling]

_Postconditions for each step:_

* Verify with a Maven build: `./mvnw -Prewrite rewrite:run clean install javadoc:javadoc` (fix all Javadoc errors/warnings, all tests must pass)
* GIT commit each verified step

==== C2. Configuration Support
[ ] _Priority:_ High

_Description:_ Implement UI configuration, static configuration file support, environment variable support, and ensure configuration precedence and reload.

==== S1. Security &amp; Performance
[ ] _Priority:_ High

_Description:_ Enforce secure algorithms, key management, and HTTPS; implement caching, memory, and performance limits; integrate security event monitoring.

_Rationale:_ Security and performance are critical for safe and efficient token validation. See Requirements NIFI-AUTH-8, NIFI-AUTH-9 in link:Requirements.adoc[Requirements].

==== I1. Internationalization (i18n)
[ ] _Priority:_ Medium

_Description:_ Internationalize all user-facing strings, provide resource bundles for English and German, and internationalize error messages and UI components.

_Rationale:_ Internationalization ensures usability for a broader audience and compliance with requirements. See Requirements NIFI-AUTH-17 in link:Requirements.adoc[Requirements].
