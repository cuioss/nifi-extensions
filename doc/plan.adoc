== Implementation Tasks

=== Core Components

==== C1. MultiIssuerJWTTokenAuthenticator Processor
[~] _Priority:_ High

_Description:_ Implement the processor class and relationships, integrate cui-jwt-validation for token validation, support multiple issuers and dynamic issuer configuration, implement property descriptors and dynamic properties, output attributes for success/failure, and error handling with standardized error codes.

_Rationale:_ This is the core component that provides JWT validation and routing, fulfilling the main requirements for authentication and authorization in NiFi flows. See Requirements NIFI-AUTH-2, NIFI-AUTH-3, NIFI-AUTH-4 in link:Requirements.adoc[Requirements].

_Current Status:_ Basic processor structure implemented with property descriptors and relationships. Token extraction logic is in place. Integration with cui-jwt-validation is partially implemented.

_Postconditions for each step:_

* Verify with a Maven build: `./mvnw -Prewrite rewrite:run clean install javadoc:javadoc` (fix all Javadoc errors/warnings, all tests must pass)
* GIT commit each verified step

==== C2. Configuration Support
[~] _Priority:_ High

_Description:_ Implement UI configuration, static configuration file support, environment variable support, and ensure configuration precedence and reload.

_Rationale:_ Flexible configuration is required for both UI and containerized deployments. See Requirements NIFI-AUTH-7.1, NIFI-AUTH-7.7 in link:Requirements.adoc[Requirements].

_Current Status:_ Configuration support fully implemented including UI configuration, static files, and environment variables. Dynamic property support fully implemented. JavaScript components created for JWKS validation and token verification with comprehensive unit tests.

==== C3. REST API Implementation
[ ] _Priority:_ High

_Description:_ Implement the backend REST API endpoints required by the custom UI components for JWKS validation, token verification, and issuer configuration management.

_Rationale:_ The custom UI components rely on backend REST API endpoints to perform their functions. Without these endpoints, the UI components cannot communicate with the processor to validate JWKS URLs, verify tokens, or manage issuer configurations.

_Current Status:_ The custom UI components (JWKS validator, token verifier, issuer config editor) have been implemented, but the backend REST API endpoints they need to communicate with are missing. This is causing the custom UI tabs to not appear or function correctly.
