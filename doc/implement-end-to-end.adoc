link:Specification.adoc[Back to Main Specification]

== Overview

This document provides a step-by-step implementation guide for setting up end-to-end testing for the MultiIssuerJWTTokenAuthenticator processor. It serves as an actionable plan to implement the testing approach described in the link:specification/end-to-end-testing.adoc[End-to-End Testing Specification].

The implementation follows a phased approach, allowing incremental deployment and verification of the testing infrastructure and test cases.

== Prerequisites

Before beginning implementation, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

* Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher
* Apache Maven 3.8.0 or higher
* Node.js 16.x or higher
* Docker 24.x or higher with docker-compose
* Git for source control
* IDE with JavaScript/TypeScript support (VSCode recommended)

== Implementation Plan

[NOTE]
====
Refer to the link:specification/end-to-end-testing.adoc#_containerized_testing_environment[Containerized Testing Environment] section in the specification for detailed requirements.
====

==== Implementation Status

Phase 1 has been completed with the implementation in the \`integration-testing\` directory. The environment provides:

1. Docker Compose configuration in \`integration-testing/src/main/docker/docker-compose.yml\` with NiFi and Keycloak containers
2. Helper scripts for environment management:
* \`run-test-container.sh\`: Builds NAR, checks certificates, starts containers
* \`stop-test-container.sh\`: Stops and removes containers
* \`copy-deployment.sh\`: Builds NAR and copies to deployment location
* \`redeploy-nifi.sh\`: Rebuilds and redeploys during development
3. Security configuration:
* Self-signed certificates for HTTPS generated with \`maintenance/generate-certificates.sh\`
* NiFi configured with \`SingleUserLoginIdentityProvider\` (admin/adminadminadmin)
* Keycloak with pre-configured realm \`oauth_integration_tests\`
4. Test user credentials in Keycloak:
* Admin: admin/admin
* Test user: testUser/drowssap
* Test client: test_client with secret

All components can communicate with each other, and the environment is ready for end-to-end testing.

== Test Code Structure

Refer to the link:specification/end-to-end-testing.adoc#_test_code_structure[Test Code Structure] section in the End-to-End Testing Specification for detailed information about the test code organization.

== Console Error Verification Implementation

Follow these steps to implement the console error verification system:

1. Create the allowlist file:

[source,bash]
----
mkdir -p nifi-cuioss-ui/cypress/support
touch nifi-cuioss-ui/cypress/support/console-warnings-allowlist.js
----

2. Implement the allowlist with initial known warnings:

[source,javascript]
----
// Add only warnings that cannot be fixed
module.exports = [
  'Warning: validateDOMNesting(...): <div> cannot appear as a descendant of <p>.',
  'DevTools failed to load source map',
  'Content Security Policy violation for inline script'
];
----

3. Implement console error tracking in Cypress:

[source,bash]
----
touch nifi-cuioss-ui/cypress/support/console-error-tracking.js
----

4. Add the console error tracking implementation as specified in the link:specification/end-to-end-testing.adoc#_console_error_verification[Console Error Verification] section.

== Maven Integration

To integrate with Maven, follow these steps:

1. Configure the \`frontend-maven-plugin\` in the \`nifi-cuioss-ui/pom.xml\` file
2. Add the necessary NPM scripts to \`package.json\`
3. Configure the Maven Failsafe plugin for integration testing
4. Set up system properties for test environment URLs

Refer to the link:specification/end-to-end-testing.adoc#_maven_integration[Maven Integration] section for detailed configuration examples.

== CI/CD Integration

For CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions:

1. Create a workflow file at \`.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml\`
2. Configure the workflow to set up Node.js and Java
3. Add steps to start the test environment
4. Configure Cypress test execution
5. Add steps for console error analysis
6. Configure artifact upload for test results

Refer to the link:specification/end-to-end-testing.adoc#_ci_cd_integration[CI/CD Integration] section for workflow configuration examples.

== Monitoring and Maintenance

After implementation, establish a maintenance process:

1. Schedule regular reviews of the allowed warnings list
2. Monitor test stability and flakiness
3. Update tests when the UI changes
4. Regularly update test data and fixtures
5. Review console error analysis reports for trends

Refer to the link:specification/end-to-end-testing.adoc#_test_maintenance[Test Maintenance] section for best practices.
