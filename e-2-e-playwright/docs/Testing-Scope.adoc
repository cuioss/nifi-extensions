== Purpose

This document defines the scope and capabilities of the NiFi E2E Playwright testing framework after refactoring to focus on processor verification and interaction rather than lifecycle management.

* xref:../README.adoc[E2E Playwright Tests] - Main module documentation

== Overview

The NiFi E2E Playwright testing framework provides automated testing capabilities for NiFi Extensions, focusing on processor verification and interaction rather than lifecycle management.

== ‚úÖ Supported Operations

=== Authentication &amp; Navigation

* *Login/Logout*: Full authentication flow with NiFi instances
* *Page Navigation*: Navigate between different NiFi pages
* *Session Management*: Maintain and verify authentication state
* *Page Verification*: Verify correct page types and readiness

=== Processor Discovery &amp; Verification

* *Processor Finding*: Locate existing processors on the canvas by name/type
* *Deployment Verification*: Verify processors are correctly deployed
* *Status Checking*: Extract processor status and state information
* *Property Inspection*: Access processor properties and configuration
* *Visibility Verification*: Confirm processors are visible on the canvas

=== Canvas Analysis

* *Element Detection*: Find and analyze canvas elements
* *Position Tracking*: Get processor positions and layout information
* *State Monitoring*: Monitor processor states and changes
* *Screenshot Capture*: Take screenshots for debugging and verification

=== Processor Interaction

* *Double-click Actions*: Attempt to open processor configuration dialogs
* *Element Access*: Direct access to processor DOM elements
* *Basic Interactions*: Simple interactions with processor elements

== ‚ùå Limitations and Restrictions

=== UI Lifecycle Management

* *Adding Processors*: Cannot drag-and-drop processors from toolbar to canvas
* *Removing Processors*: Cannot delete processors through context menus
* *Component Creation*: Cannot create new NiFi components
* *Component Deletion*: Cannot remove existing NiFi components

=== Complex UI Interactions

* *Drag-and-Drop*: Limited support for complex drag-and-drop operations
* *Context Menus*: Unreliable interaction with right-click context menus
* *Modal Dialogs*: Configuration dialogs may not consistently appear
* *Complex Workflows*: Multi-step UI workflows are not supported

=== Technical Reasons for Limitations

. *Angular Material Complexity*: NiFi's Angular Material UI has complex event handling
. *Dynamic DOM*: Canvas elements are dynamically generated and managed
. *Event Propagation*: UI events don't always propagate correctly in test environment
. *State Management*: NiFi's state management interferes with test automation

== üéØ Recommended Testing Strategy

=== Pre-Test Setup

. *Deploy processors manually* through NiFi's standard deployment process
. *Configure test environment* with required processors already on canvas
. *Ensure clean state* before running tests

=== Test Implementation

. *Focus on verification* rather than creation
. *Test processor functionality* rather than UI operations
. *Verify deployment and status* of existing processors
. *Check configuration and properties* of deployed processors

=== Example Test Patterns

==== ‚úÖ Good Test Pattern

[source,javascript]
----
test("should verify processor deployment", async ({ page }) => {
  // Verify processor is deployed and accessible
  const verification = await verifyProcessorDeployment(page, "MyProcessor");

  expect(verification.found).toBeTruthy();
  expect(verification.visible).toBeTruthy();
  expect(verification.details.name).toContain("MyProcessor");
});
----

==== ‚ùå Avoid This Pattern

[source,javascript]
----
test("should add and remove processor", async ({ page }) => {
  // This will fail due to technical limitations
  await addProcessor(page, "MyProcessor");  // NOT SUPPORTED
  await removeProcessor(page, "MyProcessor");  // NOT SUPPORTED
});
----

== üîß Framework Architecture

=== Core Components

* *processor-tool.js*: Processor discovery and verification utilities
* *login-tool.js*: Authentication and session management
* *navigation-tool.js*: Page navigation and verification
* *constants.js*: Selectors and configuration constants

=== Test Structure

----
tests/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ self-processor.spec.js          # Processor verification tests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ self-login-tool.spec.js         # Authentication tests
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ self-navigation-tool.spec.js    # Navigation tests
----

=== Utility Functions

* `findProcessor()`: Locate processors on canvas
* `verifyProcessorDeployment()`: Comprehensive processor verification
* `interactWithProcessor()`: Basic processor interaction
* `ensureNiFiReady()`: Prepare NiFi for testing

== üìã Test Checklist

Before writing tests, ensure:
- [ ] Processors are deployed through standard NiFi deployment
- [ ] Test focuses on verification rather than creation
- [ ] Expectations are realistic for framework capabilities
- [ ] Error handling accounts for UI limitations
- [ ] Screenshots are captured for debugging

== üêõ Troubleshooting

=== Common Issues

. *Processor not found*: Check deployment and selector accuracy
. *Interaction failures*: Expected due to dialog complexity
. *Authentication issues*: Verify credentials and service availability
. *Timeout errors*: Increase timeouts for slow UI loading

=== Debug Resources

* Screenshots automatically captured in `target/screenshots/`
* Browser console logs available in test output
* Network requests logged for authentication debugging
* Page context information for state verification

== üìà Future Enhancements

=== Potential Improvements

. *Enhanced Status Detection*: More sophisticated processor state analysis
. *Configuration Reading*: Better property extraction from processors
. *Batch Operations*: Support for testing multiple processors
. *Integration Testing*: Cross-processor workflow verification

=== Research Areas

. *Alternative Interaction Methods*: Find ways to bypass UI limitations
. *API Integration*: Combine UI tests with REST API verification
. *Performance Monitoring*: Add performance metrics to tests
. *Error Pattern Analysis*: Improve error detection and reporting

This framework provides a solid foundation for verifying NiFi processor deployment and basic functionality within the defined scope and limitations.
