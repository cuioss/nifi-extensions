== Overview

The e-2-e-playwright module provides automated end-to-end testing for NiFi Extensions using the Playwright testing framework. These tests validate the functionality of NiFi Extensions in a real NiFi environment.

== Core Concepts

=== ✅ Supported Capabilities

The testing framework is capable of:

* **Authentication** - Login to NiFi using test credentials
* **Navigation** - Moving between NiFi pages and verifying page states
* **Processor Discovery** - Finding existing processors deployed on the canvas
* **Processor Interaction** - Accessing and interacting with deployed processors
* **Canvas Analysis** - Analyzing the NiFi canvas and its components
* **Configuration Verification** - Verifying processor configuration and properties

For detailed information about testing scope and capabilities, see xref:docs/Testing-Scope.adoc[Testing Scope and Capabilities].

=== ❌ Technical Limitations

Due to the complexity of NiFi's Angular Material UI and drag-and-drop interactions, the following operations are **NOT supported**:

* **Adding Processors** - Complex drag-and-drop from toolbar to canvas
* **Removing Processors** - Complex context menu and confirmation workflows
* **Component Creation** - Creating new canvas components
* **Component Deletion** - Deleting existing canvas components

=== 🎯 Testing Strategy

The framework is designed to test **deployed processors** rather than processor lifecycle management. Tests should:

1. **Verify processor deployment** - Confirm processors are correctly deployed to NiFi
2. **Test processor functionality** - Interact with existing processors to verify behavior
3. **Validate configuration** - Check processor properties and settings
4. **Monitor processor state** - Verify processor status and health

*Note: Processors should be deployed through the standard NiFi deployment process (NAR files) before running tests.*

== Detailed Component Documentation

=== Module Structure

* `tests/` - Contains the Playwright test files
* `utils/` - Contains helper functions and utilities
* `scripts/` - Contains scripts for log analysis and other utilities

=== Core Components

* **processor-tool.js** - Utilities for processor discovery and verification
* **login-tool.js** - Authentication and session management
* **navigation-tool.js** - Page navigation and verification
* **constants.js** - Selectors and configuration constants

For detailed information about the NiFi UI structure, see xref:docs/nifi-ui-structure.adoc[NiFi UI Structure Guide].

== Configuration

The Playwright configuration is defined in `playwright.config.js`. It includes settings for:

* Test timeouts
* Browser configuration
* Screenshot and video capture
* Reporting

=== Maven Standard Directory Structure

This module follows the Maven standard directory structure for test artifacts. All temporary files are stored in the `target` directory:

* `target/test-results` - Contains test results and traces
* `target/playwright-report` - Contains HTML reports
* `target/screenshots` - Contains screenshots taken during tests
* `target/videos` - Contains videos recorded during tests

This ensures that all temporary artifacts are properly managed and can be cleaned up with `mvn clean`.

== Test Requirements

The Playwright tests in this module are designed to run against a live NiFi instance. Before running the tests, ensure that:

1. NiFi is running and accessible at the URL specified in `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL` (default: https://localhost:9095/nifi)
2. Keycloak is running and accessible at the URL specified in `PLAYWRIGHT_KEYCLOAK_URL` (default: http://localhost:9080)
3. The test user credentials in `utils/constants.js` are valid for the running NiFi instance

The tests will fail if NiFi is not running or not accessible.

== Running Tests

=== Via Maven

To run the tests via Maven:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw clean verify -pl e-2-e-playwright -Pintegration-tests
----

=== Via npm

To run the tests directly via npm:

[source,bash]
----
cd e-2-e-playwright
npm run playwright:test
----

For headed mode (with browser UI):

[source,bash]
----
npm run playwright:test:headed
----

For interactive UI mode:

[source,bash]
----
npm run playwright:test:ui
----

== Viewing Reports

After running tests, you can view the HTML report:

[source,bash]
----
npm run playwright:report
----

== Generating Tests

Playwright includes a code generation tool to help create tests:

[source,bash]
----
npm run playwright:codegen
----

== Environment Variables

* `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL` - Base URL for NiFi (default: https://localhost:9095/nifi)
* `PLAYWRIGHT_KEYCLOAK_URL` - URL for Keycloak (default: http://localhost:9080)

== Usage Examples

=== Basic Processor Verification

[source,javascript]
----
// Example: Verify a processor is deployed and accessible
test("should verify processor deployment", async ({ page }) => {
  // Login to NiFi
  await loginToNiFi(page);

  // Navigate to canvas
  await navigateToCanvas(page);

  // Verify processor is deployed and accessible
  const verification = await verifyProcessorDeployment(page, "MyProcessor");

  expect(verification.found).toBeTruthy();
  expect(verification.visible).toBeTruthy();
  expect(verification.details.name).toContain("MyProcessor");
});
----

=== Authentication and Navigation

[source,javascript]
----
// Example: Login and navigate to different pages
test("should navigate through NiFi UI", async ({ page }) => {
  // Login to NiFi
  await loginToNiFi(page);

  // Verify we're on the main canvas
  await verifyPageType(page, "MAIN_CANVAS");

  // Take screenshot for documentation
  await page.screenshot({ path: "target/screenshots/main-canvas.png" });
});
----

== Best Practices

* **Pre-deploy processors** - Deploy processors through standard NiFi deployment before testing
* **Focus on verification** - Test processor functionality rather than UI operations
* **Use reliable selectors** - Prefer data-testid attributes when available
* **Handle timeouts** - Set appropriate timeouts for UI operations
* **Capture screenshots** - Use screenshots for debugging and documentation
* **Clean up resources** - Ensure tests clean up after themselves
* **Isolate tests** - Each test should be independent and not rely on other tests

== Technical Details

=== Thread Safety

* Tests run in isolated browser contexts
* Each test gets a fresh page instance
* No shared state between tests

=== Performance Considerations

* Authentication is the slowest operation (~3-5 seconds)
* Page navigation takes ~1-2 seconds
* Processor verification is relatively fast (~0.5 seconds)
* Screenshots add minimal overhead

=== Implementation Notes

* Built on Playwright 1.32.0+
* Uses Jest-compatible assertions
* Supports parallel test execution
* Compatible with CI/CD pipelines
