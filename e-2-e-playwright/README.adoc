== Test Categories

Tests are organized into three categories, executed in order:

=== Self-Tests (`self-*.spec.js`)

Framework validation tests that verify prerequisites before functional tests run.
Covers login, navigation, browser logging, critical error detection, and processor interaction.

=== Functional Tests (`0x-*.spec.js`)

Tests for specific JWT processor features: custom UI tabs, JWKS validation, token verification, metrics, and help content.

=== Accessibility Tests (`accessibility-*.spec.js`)

WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance testing using @axe-core/playwright.
See xref:docs/accessibility-testing-guide.adoc[Accessibility Testing Guide] for details.

== Prerequisites

Tests require a running NiFi + Keycloak environment:

1. *NiFi* accessible at `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL` (default: `https://localhost:9095/nifi`)
2. *Keycloak* accessible at `PLAYWRIGHT_KEYCLOAK_URL` (default: `http://localhost:9080`)
3. *Test credentials* configured in `utils/constants.js` must be valid

=== Starting the Test Environment

[source,bash]
----
# Build NAR, start Keycloak + NiFi containers (first time or after stop)
./integration-testing/src/main/docker/run-and-deploy.sh

# Quick redeploy after code changes (preserves running containers)
./integration-testing/src/main/docker/redeploy-nifi.sh

# Stop all containers
./integration-testing/src/main/docker/stop-test-container.sh
----

The `run-and-deploy.sh` script builds the NAR file, starts Keycloak (with health check), then starts NiFi.
Once running, NiFi is available at `https://localhost:9095/nifi` and Keycloak at `http://localhost:9080`.

== Running Tests

=== Via Maven (recommended for CI)

Tests are *skipped by default*. The `integration-tests` profile enables them and manages Docker containers automatically:

[source,bash]
----
# Full integration test suite: starts containers → self-tests → functional → accessibility → stops containers
./mvnw clean verify -pl e-2-e-playwright -Pintegration-tests
----

Maven separates results into distinct directories:

* `target/results-selftests/` — self-test artifacts
* `target/results-functional-tests/` — functional test artifacts
* `target/results-accessibility-tests/` — accessibility test artifacts

=== Via npm (for development)

Requires a running NiFi + Keycloak environment.

[source,bash]
----
# All tests with self-test pre-check gating
npm test

# Direct Playwright execution
npm run playwright:test

# Headed mode (visible browser)
npm run playwright:test:headed

# Interactive UI mode
npm run playwright:test:ui
----

=== Targeted Test Execution

[source,bash]
----
# Self-tests only
npm run test:self

# JWT-related tests with pre-checks
npm run test:jwt

# Accessibility tests
npm run test:a11y              # Standard
npm run test:a11y:full         # With HTML report
npm run test:a11y:quick        # Quick WCAG check only

# Skip self-test pre-checks
npm run test:no-precheck
----

== Code Quality

[source,bash]
----
# ESLint
npm run lint                   # Check
npm run lint:fix               # Auto-fix
npm run lint:strict            # Strict mode (max 30 warnings)

# Prettier
npm run format:check           # Verify formatting
npm run format                 # Auto-format
----

== Configuration

=== Playwright (`playwright.config.cjs`)

* *Browser*: Chromium only (enterprise standard, best Playwright support)
* *Reporters*: JSON (`target/test-results.json`), JUnit (`target/junit-results.xml`), list
* *Artifacts*: Trace, screenshots, and video are all `on` by default
* *Parallel*: `fullyParallel: true`, 1 worker locally, 2 in CI
* *Timeouts*: 60s test, 15s expect, 10s action, 30s navigation

=== Test Artifacts

All artifacts are stored under `target/`:

== Architecture

=== Test Fixtures

Fixtures in `fixtures/test-fixtures.js` provide automatic:

* Authentication setup
* Browser console log capture and file storage
* Critical error detection
* Accessibility helper injection
* Processor API manager

=== Processor Management

Two approaches for working with processors:

* *UI-based* (`utils/processor.js`) — Discover and verify processors on the canvas
* *API-based* (`utils/processor-api-manager.js`) — Manage processors via NiFi REST API (add, remove, start, stop)

See xref:docs/processor-api-manager-guide.adoc[Processor API Manager Guide] for details.

== Scope and Limitations

=== Supported Operations

* Authentication (Keycloak OAuth, API token-based)
* Canvas navigation and page verification
* Processor discovery, status checking, and property inspection
* Processor lifecycle via REST API (`ProcessorApiManager`)
* WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility testing
* Browser console log analysis

=== UI Automation Limitations

Due to NiFi's Angular Material UI complexity:

* Drag-and-drop operations are unreliable (use API-based management instead)
* Right-click context menus are inconsistent
* Complex multi-step UI workflows may not work reliably
